Abstract. The carbon (C) cycle in boreal regions is strongly
inﬂuenced by ﬁre, which converts biomass and detrital C
mainlytogaseousforms(CO 2andsmallerproportionsofCO
and CH 4), and some 1–3% of mass to pyrogenic C (PyC).
PyC is mainly produced as solid charred residues, including
visually-deﬁned charcoal, and a black carbon (BC) fraction
chemically deﬁned by its resistance to laboratory oxidation,
plus much lower proportions of volatile soot and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). All PyC is characterized by
fused aromatic rings, but varying in cluster sizes, and pres-
ence of other elements (N, O) and functional groups. The
range of PyC structures is often described as a continuum
from partially charred plant materials, to charcoal, soot and
ultimately graphite which is formed by the combination of
heat and pressure. There are several reasons for current in-
terest in deﬁning more precisely the role of PyC in the C
cycle of boreal regions. First, PyC is largely resistant to de-
composition,andthereforecontributestoverystableCpools
in soils and sediments. Second, it inﬂuences soil processes,
mainly through its sorption properties and cation exchange
capacity, and third, soot aerosols absorb solar radiation and
may contribute to global warming. However, there are large
gaps in the basic information needed to address these topics.
While charcoal is commonly deﬁned by visual criteria, ana-
lyticalmethodsforBCaremainlybasedonvariousmeasures
ofoxidationresistance,oronyieldofbenzenepolycarboxylic
acids. These methods are still being developed, and capture
different fractions of the PyC structural continuum. There
are few quantitative reports of PyC production and stocks
in boreal forests (essentially none for boreal peatlands), and
results are difﬁcult to compare due to varying experimen-
tal goals and methods, as well as inconsistent terminology.

1 Introduction
Fire is a major driver of ecosystem processes and the carbon
(C)cycleinborealforestsandpeatlands(Hickeetal.,2003).
Globally, it has been estimated that one-third of net primary
productivity in boreal forests is consumed by ﬁre (Harden et
al., 2000; Wirth et al., 2002), while Bachelet et al. (2005)
concludedthat61%oftheCgainedinAlaskabetween1922

et al. (2006b)1. The upper part represented PyC (here called black
carbon BC) plotted along a scale of atomic H/C and O/C ratios,
also used in van Krevelen plots (the H/C scale is non-linear). The
lower part of the ﬁgure is a conceptual summary of the compara-
tive analyses of the seven methods to quantify black carbon. The
analysis typically has two steps, separation and quantiﬁcation. (1)
Separation of BC was performed by seven methods A-G. The an-
alytical ranges of separation are conceptual only, visualized by the
use of solid and dotted lines. The dotted lines at each end of the
solid lines and above “Estimated inaccuracy” next to each method
(A-G) indicate the level of inaccuracy – the more dots, the larger
the estimated inaccuracy. (2) Quantiﬁcation of BC in the opera-
tionally deﬁned separates includes elemental analysis (to quantify
carbon left after separation),13C NMR spectroscopy (to identify
condensed aromatic C) or the use of gas chromatography to quan-
tify the molecular markersof black carbon.
to 1996 was lost to ﬁres (1 out of 1.7PgC). Conard and
Ivanova (1997) estimated that boreal forest ﬁres accounted
for about 20% of C emissions from global biomass burning.
Amiroetal.(2001)estimatedthatCemissionfromCanadian
forestﬁresduring1959–1999amountedto18%ofemissions
from all energy sources in Canada, with a similar magnitude
of secondary CO 2emission due to postﬁre decomposition.
The retrospective analysis by Kurz and Apps (1999) indi-
cated that Canada’s forests functioned as a sink for atmo-
spheric C during the period 1920–1990. After 1970 how-
ever, increases in ﬁre and insect disturbances have moved
the balance closer to neutral or even to C loss. Increasing
burn areas are predicted for boreal forests of Canada, Rus-
sia and Alaska under warmer and drier conditions resulting
from increased atmospheric CO 2(Stocks et al., 1998, 2000;
Bachelet et al., 2005; Flannigan et al., 2001, 2005). One ob-

quency during the Holocene (e.g., Clark and Royall, 1994;
Laird and Campbell, 2000; Flannigan et al., 2001; Sanbornet al., 2006). Recently, there has been increasing interest
in other aspects of charred biomass, or more generally, the
wholerangeofPyCforms(Hedgesetal.,2000;Schmidtand
Noack, 2000; Schmidt et al., 2001; Masiello, 2004). First,
how much does PyC contribute to very stable soil C pools;
i.e., what is its sink potential? Second, how does PyC in-
ﬂuence soil processes such as microbial activity and nutri-
ent cycling, and third what are the effects of volatile emis-
sions on air quality and atmospheric warming? Despite high
interest in these aspects of PyC, and the huge inﬂuence of
ﬁre in boreal regions, there are few quantitative reports of
PyC production and stocks and little direct information on
mechanisms and rates of loss in boreal regions, especially
for peatlands. We review the current state of knowledge on
PyC, including chemical structures, deﬁnition of terms, ana-
lyticalmethodsandquantitation,formationofPyCincluding
soot aerosols and PAHs, stocks and characteristics of PyC
in soil, and loss mechanisms and longevity, and from this
background consider the role of PyC in boreal regions, with
regard to C cycle, effects on soil processes, and identiﬁca-
tion of knowledge gaps and research needs. We wish to en-
gageahighlyinterdisciplinaryaudienceincludingsoilscien-
tists, forest and peat ecologists, ﬁre scientists and C budget
modelers, and hope to encourage novel interdisciplinary ap-
proaches to address these gaps. While the focus is on boreal
regions,weincludeinformationfromotherregionstosetthe
boreal picture in a global context, and also as an aid in inter-
pretation of the inadequate boreal data. We focus on recent
and generally available publications providing access to fur-
ther literature, rather than a comprehensive literature survey.
2 What is PyC?
TherangeofPyCstructuresisoftendescribedasa continuum
from partially charred plant materials that still retain their
physical structure, to charcoal, soot and ultimately graphite
(Seiler and Crutzen, 1980). This is visualized in Fig. 1,
which also indicates the terminology, the associated chem-
ical properties, and ranges of operationally deﬁned analyti-
cal windows. PyC can form in two fundamentally different
ways. The solid residues of combustion form char, whereas
sootisformedfromvolatilesformedwithinandrecondensed
from ﬂames. The common, deﬁning characteristic of ﬁre-
altered biomass is the presence of condensed (fused) aro-
matic ring structures. As the extent of thermal alteration
increases, structures with small cross-linked aromatic clus-
ters (Fig. 2a) give way to larger graphene sheets (Fig. 2b)
that tend to form stacks with disordered packing (Fig. 2c).

sors requires both heat and pressure and therefore it is not a
direct product of ﬁre. Lighter polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons (PAHs) having structures of 2–7 fused aromatic rings

sidered part of the PyC continuum.
Functional groups contain mainly oxygen (O) or hydro-
gen (H), and the degree of functionalization is reﬂected in
the molar ratios O/C and H/C shown as a van Krevelen plot
(Fig. 3). The number of functional groups, important for
biological degradability, decreases continously from the ini-
tial, thermally unaltered biomass to increasingly thermally-
altered structures. Large O/C and H/C ratios indicate the
presence of many functional groups, whereas smaller ratios
are typical for more condensed structures, with ratios close
to 0.0 typical for almost pure carbon. It should be noted that
molar ratios are typically used in geochemical studies and
in this review, whereas most forestry and soil studies report
mass concentration ratios.

3.1 Quantitative analysis
Figure 1 shows the principal geochemical approaches that
havebeendevelopedmainlytoquantifyPyCinsoilsandsed-
iments. More detailed reviews and comparisons are given
elsewhere (Kuhlbusch, 1998; Schmidt and Noack, 2000;
Schmidt et al., 2001; Masiello, 2004; Cornelissen et al.,
2005; Elmquist et al., 2006; Hammes et al., 2006b1).
Analytical techniques for PyC in sediments and soils at-
tempt to differentiate between three forms of C, i.e. inor-
ganiccarbonates,thermallyunalteredorganicC(suchashu-
mic substances and plant material) and PyC. Carbonates are
released as CO 2by HCl pretreatment, and the multitude of
methods to differentiate PyC from other organic C, essen-
tially all fall into three categories. First, visual or micro-
scopic techniques rely on visual discrimination of charred
(i.e. blackened) vs. uncharred plant particles, followed by
particle counting or actual physical separation and weigh-
ing. This fraction has been traditionally described as char-
coal,althoughitisunclearhowmuchofthecharredresidues

distinguish a BC fraction from other organic matter (sum-
marized by Hammes et al., 2006a). These methods have
mainly been developed for soils and sediments, and there
are many variations, of which the most vigorous extraction
and oxidation treatments leave only graphitic BC (GBC),
(G´elinasetal.,2001). Photooxidationisoftencombinedwith
analysis of the residues by13C nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR)spectroscopytodistinguishBCfromotheroxidation-
resistant organic C. The third approach is based on the re-
lease of molecular markers unambiguously related to PyC,
namelyproductionofbenzenepolycarboxylicacids(BPCAs)
after nitric acid oxidation (Glaser et al., 1998; Brodowski et
al.,2005b). Levoglucosanwhichisproducedfromheatingof

lemisthattermsarenotusedconsistently. BChascommonlybeen used to describe the whole continuum, but it is now
more often used to specify the more resistant PyC fraction
determined by resistance to laboratory oxidation or by pro-
duction of BPCAs. The term elemental C (EC) has become
more widespread to deﬁne the oxidation-resistant fraction in
analysis of atmospheric aerosols and soot.
Inthispaper,weusePyCforthewholecontinuumofﬁre-
altered biomass and organic matter (sometimes called pyro-
morphic materials), char for the visually-detected fraction,
and BC and GBC for the fractions deﬁned chemically by re-
sistance to oxidation, or by production of BPCAs. We use
charcoal only where it has been reported as such, based on
visual assessment, and similarly, use EC only where it has
been reported as such for atmospheric studies. As methods
for analysis of PyC are still under development, and deﬁni-
tions are not standardized, readers should check how terms
are used in different publications.
Quantiﬁcation of PyC or BC fractions remains challeng-
ing. WereemphasizethatPyCconstitutesacontinuumwith-
out clear-cut structural boundaries, and that both visual and
oxidationmethodsareoperationally-deﬁnedandcapturedif-
ferent regions. The BPCA method is a complex multi-step
procedure, highly sensitive to operating conditions, and also
dependent on the factor used – or sometimes not used (e.g.,
Rodionow et al., 2006) to convert BPCA yields to BC. It
detects only C in larger aromatic clusters, and both oxida-
tion and BPCA procedures hardly detect the bulk of charred
biomass or even laboratory-produced char. A recent com-
parative analysis of soils (Schmidt et al., 2001) showed that
BCconcentrationsobtainedbydifferentmethodscanvaryby
twoordersofmagnitude,dependingonthetypeofseparation
technique used (e.g. Currie et al., 2002). Brieﬂy, particle
size, morphology, and the presence or absence of a mineral
matrixmayleadtoanover-orunderestimationofthecontent
ofpyrogenicorganicmatter(Masiello,2004;Elmquistetal.,
2006).
A new systematic comparative analysis was started in
2003 (Schmidt et al., 2003; Hammes et al., 2006a; http:
//www.geo.unizh.ch/phys/bc/ ). Brieﬂy, simple correlation
factors between methods and matrices were not apparent,
and each method may have limitations and biases, depend-
ingonthetypeofﬁre-derivedcarbonandmatrix. Thisstudy
has made clear that future studies urgently need to be cali-
brated against the set of BC reference materials analyzed by
Hammes et al. (2006a).
3.2 Characterization of PyC
Once pyrogenic organic matter is separated; e.g., by visual
methods or photooxidation, it can be characterized by ele-
mental analysis (e.g., C, N, H, O). While total C and N can
be readily determined, H analysis is not routinely available,
and total O is often determined by difference. Since the van
Krevelen O/C and H/C ratios are so central to the proper-
tiesofPyC,moreapplicationofelementalanalysiswouldbe

most useful, especially for freshly charred material uncom-
plicated by a mineral matrix.
The increasing proportions of aromatic C and loss of
oxygen-containing functional groups with charring can be
observed directly by13C NMR. Spectra of charred biomass
and SOM are characterized by a broad aromatic signal with
maximumaround125–130ppm,whichcanaccountforupto
100% of the organic C (Baldock and Smernik, 2002; Czim-
czik et al., 2002, 2003; Gonz ´alez-P´erez et al., 2004; Simp-
son and Hatcher, 2004a, b; Knicker et al., 2005a, b). Con-
densed aromatic structures are poorly detected by routine
solid-stateNMRwithcross-polarization(CP),sothatamore
time-consuming quantitative technique (Bloch decay, BD)
must be used. The13C NMR spectra in Fig. 4 illustrate the
effects of charring on Scots pine wood from a wildﬁre (Cz-
imczik et al., 2003). The CP spectrum of the fresh wood
(Fig. 4a) is dominated by the O-alkyl peak of cellulose at
73 ppm. The CP spectrum of the charred wood (Fig. 4b) is
dominated by aromatic C at 125ppm, with small peaks due
to residual cellulose, and an increase in alkyl C (37ppm).
The corresponding quantitative BD spectrum (Fig. 4c) has a
higher proportion of aromatic carbon than the CP spectrum.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy actu-
ally reveals the condensed aromatic clusters, in both dis-
ordered and concentric onion-like structures (Poirier et al.,
2000; Schmidt et al., 2002). Other novel approaches to
BCcharacterizationincludeultra-high-resolutionmassspec-
trometry(Kimetal.,2004;Krameretal.,2004),andvarious
forms of X-ray spectroscopy (Solomon et al., 2005), which
have been coupled with microscopic techniques to produce
spatial distribution of BC forms (Brodowski et al., 2005a;
Lehmann et al., 2005).

production of 235–932kgha−1from experimental ﬁres with

1998;OhlsonandTryterud,2000;Lynchetal.,2004). These

withcharcoalyieldsdeterminedfromrecoveryofparticlesin
surface traps; i.e., particles that were airborne at some point
during the ﬁre.
No other boreal data could be located, but generally
higher yields are reported in the few other studies available.
These are mainly from experimental slash-burning after for-
est clearing: i.e., 7400kgha−1of forest ﬂoor charcoal at asite in Virginia (Schiffman and Johnson, 1989), and 1140–
4540kgha−1charfromfourstudiesinAmazonia(Fearnside
et al., 1993, 1999, 2001; Grac ¸a et al., 1999). Conversion
of 5.1% of initial mass produced 7070kgha−1of charred
particles >1000 µm (8.5% conversion on a C basis) during
a slash-pile-and-burn experiment designed to emulate Ne-
olithic practices in temperate deciduous forest (Eckmeier et
al.,20062). Muchgreaterincreasesinsitecharcoal( <2mm,
to 30cm depth), of 20000 and 170000kgha−1, were re-
ported by Hopmans et al. (2005) after clearfelling and burn-
ing of two eucalypt sites in Australia.
In the only study following forest wildﬁre, Tinker and
Knight (2000) determined 6400kgha−1of char production
on coarse woody debris after an intense crown ﬁre in Yel-
lowstoneNationalPark. FortheborealandAmazonianﬁres,
factors for conversion of fuel to visually-determined char
were 0.9–2.2% (mass basis), with higher values for the Yel-
lowstonecoarsewoodydebrisandNeolithic-emulationstud-
ies (8% and 5.3%, respectively). Using average C concen-
trations of 500gkg−1for biomass and 700gkg−1for char,
these correspond to C conversions of approximately 1.3–
3.1%, with 11% for the Yellowstone study, and 7.4% for the
Neolithic-emulationburn(closetothe8.5%determinedfrom
actual C analysis). The three boreal ﬁre studies were de-
signedtocaptureonlycharcoalwithpotentialtobedeposited
in nearby lake sediments, and comparison with reports from
other regions suggests that charcoal production from boreal
wildﬁres is likely to be much higher than 235–932kgha−1.
Afullaccountinghastoincludecharredmaterialintheforest
ﬂoor, and on standing and down trees, and could possibly be
in the range of 5000–10000kgha−1.
Few other data are available, but it is interesting to com-
pare the results discussed so far with charcoal deposition
rates estimated from analysis of particles >10µm in lake
sediments (Clark and Royall, 1994). For pre-settlement
North America (i.e., before ﬁre suppression), the highest
rates (5000kgha−1y−1)were found in prairie/forest bor-
der areas, followed by conifer, largely boreal forest, with
rates of 500–5000kgha−1y−1. While the highest rates
seem improbable, and the authors emphasize the uncertain-
ties and need for further research, these results also indi-
catethatcharcoalproductionratesdeterminedfromthethree
aforementioned boreal experimental burns are probably low.
Deposition of 5000kgha−1y−1for 100y would result in
500kgm−2of charcoal, or a 10cm layer assuming a den-
sity of 0.5gcm−3and no mechanisms for loss (discussed in
Sect. 6).

CE is carbon exposed to ﬁre), or 1.3%, based on BC/CO 2-
C. From laboratory burns of 20 non-woody biomass sub-
strates, Kuhlbusch and Crutzen (1995) found that BC/CE
was 0.14–2.2%, or 0.15–2.9% as BC/CO 2-C. For deciduous
wood(meanfortwosubstrates),thevalueswerehigher,with
BC/CE 3.1%, and BC/CO 2-C 4%. Despite the differences
in methodology, burning conditions, and biomass substrates,
these results for BC yields based on chemical oxidation are
in a similar range to those in Table 1 based on visual char
assessment. This may be because visual assessment of char
is chemically inclusive, but is limited by particle-size cutoff.
On the other hand, the milder measures of oxidation resis-
tance may exclude less thermally-altered C, but access all
sample C. Conversion of C to BPCA-deﬁned BC is likely
to produce lower results, as BPCAs are only generated from
larger aromatic clusters. Clearly, the limited data on char or
BC production from forest ﬁres are an inadequate basis for
modelling their role in boreal C budgets, and it is less than
satisfactory to compare data derived from various methods

should be sufﬁcient to allow some initial attempts at model-
ing their production from boreal wildﬁre.
4.2 Atmospheric PyC emissions from forest ﬁres
Emissions from forest ﬁres into the atmosphere include
a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds (i.e.,
vapourizing at relatively low temperatures), and poorly-
characterized high-molecular-weight substances (Andreae
and Merlet, 2001; Friedli et al., 2001; Hays et al., 2002;
Duarte et al., 2005), collectively referred to as organic C
(OC) or particulate organic matter (POM). These contribute
to formation of aerosols, ﬁne particles up to around 100 µm
diameter, that remain suspended in the atmosphere. Cooke
and Wilson (1996) estimated a lifetime of 7.85 days for BC
aerosol particles, during which they increase in hydrophilic
character, and are then removed in precipitation with the
same efﬁciency as sulphate. Techniques used to quantify
atmospheric BC (often called EC in this context) generally
differ from those used for solid soot and char, and will not
be discussed here (see e.g., Schmid et al., 2001; Conny and
Slater, 2002).
Smoke aerosols affect air quality locally, such as demon-
strated for the Missoula Valley, Montana (Ward and Smith,
2005), but can also be transported over long distances. For
example,smokeplumesfromSiberianforestﬁresin2003af-
fectedairqualityoverKorea(Leeetal.,2005),andCanadian
forest ﬁres have been associated with events of elevated CO,
BC and OC over the USA (Wotawa and Trainer, 2000; Park
etal.,2003). Borealforestﬁrescontributesubstantiallytoat-
mospheric BC in the Arctic (Cooke and Wilson, 1996), and
soot deposition reduces the albedo of Arctic sea ice (Kim et
al., 2005); even Antarctica receives BC from biomass burn-
ing in the tropics (Wolff and Cachier, 1998).Inadditiontoimpactsonvisibilityandhealth,atmospheric
BC produced from fossil fuel and biomass combustion has
been identiﬁed as a contributor to global warming due to
its direct absorption of solar radiation (Jacobson, 2002), and
there have been calls for its control to mitigate this effect
(Hansen et al., 2000; Bond and Sun, 2005). This is oppo-
site to the effect of sulphate aerosols that tend to mitigate
thegreenhouseeffectbyreﬂectingsolarradiation;secondary
effects of atmospheric BC and other aerosols are discussed
elsewhere (Jacobson, 2002; Menon et al., 2002).
As shown in Table 2, global atmospheric emissions from
biomass burning, including biomass fuels, are estimated at
5–6TgBCy−1, almost as high as those from fossil fuels
(Cooke and Wilson, 1996; Liousse et al., 1996; Andreae and
Merlet, 2001). Excluding biomass and fossil fuel consump-
tion, global emissions were estimated as 3.3TgBCy−1by
Ito and Penner (2005), and northern hemisphere emissions
as 2-2.5TgECy−1by Park et al. (2003).
A detailed spatial and monthly inventory of carbonaceous
particle emission from boreal and temperate wildﬁres in
forests, shrublands and grasslands for 1960–1997 was pro-
duced by Lavou ´e et al. (2000). One key result was the very
high interannual variability: ﬁres in boreal and temperate
regions accounted for 4%, on average, of global biomass
burned, but ranged up to 11.5% of biomass burned, with
emissions up to 8.8% of BC and 19.4% of POM, due to
less complete combustion than in other ecosystems. They
noted that particle emissions from boreal ﬁres may have es-
pecially high impact in Arctic regions that are highly sen-
sitive to climate change. As shown in Table 2, BC emis-
sions from Canadian forest ﬁres, mainly from boreal re-
gions, have been increasing from 0.016TgBCy−1in 1960–
1969, to 0.041TgBCy−1in 1990–1997. This is consistent
with trends of increasing ﬁre disturbance and declining total
ecosystem C in Canadian forests (Kurz and Apps, 1999).

Parketal.(2003)estimated0.12TgECy−1emissionfrom
Canadian ﬁres for 1997–2000. The discrepancy between
this and the lower value of 0.04TgBCy−1for 1980–1997
in Lavou´e et al. (2000) is mainly due to the the different EFs
used: 2gECperkgdrymassbyParketal.(2003)compared
to 0.75 by Lavou ´e et al. (2000).
These analyses of global and regional BC emissions rest
on many assumptions and uncertain estimates, highlighting
theneedformoredirectmeasurementsofBCemissionsfrom
boreal forest ﬁres, of emission factors, and of atmospheric
BC concentrations and deposition rates. Estimated or mea-
sured EFs for BC production are generally within the range
of0.5–2gBCkg−1biomass,consistentwithEFsrecentlyde-
terminedbyHaysetal.(2002)forsixfoliarfuelsunderopen
burning to simulate natural events.
Until recently, there was little direct information on
aerosolsandgasesproducedbyborealwildﬁres. Studiescar-
ried out near Fort Providence, NWT, Canada, in jack pine
(Pinus banksiana ) as part of the International Crown Fire

tion and size distribution in smoke plumes in 2000 (Payne et
al.,2004),gasesandtotalnonmethanehydrocarbonsin1997
(Cofer et al., 1998), and BC and OC in aerosol particles in
1998 (Conny and Slater, 2002). In the latter study of parti-
clesupto2.5 µmdiameter,theBC/TCratiowasfoundtobe
0.085 for the ﬂaming stage and 0.0087 for the smouldering
stage, but EFs were not determined. However, more infor-
mation is recently available from experimental ﬁres in three
Scots pine sites of central Siberia (Samsonov et al., 2005).
Aerosol emissions corresponded to 1%–7% of the mass of
ﬁre-consumedbiomass,withECconstituting7–15%oftotal
aerosol mass. This was scaled up to an estimated 3–10Tg
aerosol mass per year for boreal Russia from 12–14million
ha burned, or 0.2–1.5Tg of EC, in line with previous esti-
mates.
4.3 PAHs from forest ﬁres

atmosphericPAHsoriginatelargelyfromfossilfuelcombus-
tion,butextensiveuseofwoodforhomeheatingwasrespon-
sible for half the atmospheric PAHs at a semirural forested
Swedish site (Mandalakis et al., 2005). PAHs can be trans-
ported long distances, especially the lighter ones (Bucheli et
al., 2004), and they are deposited in Arctic regions far from
their sources (Yunker et al., 2002; Hung et al., 2005).
PAHs are produced in the gas phase during combustion,
but at lower temperatures they rapidly condense onto ash
particles (Kim et al., 2003). Therefore PAHs formed in for-est ﬁres may be emitted as volatiles or deposited on the soil
surface with the ash. We did not locate any direct measure-
ments of PAH emission from forest ﬁres, but the previously-
noted study of Hays et al. (2002) on open burning of foliar
fuels found that PAHs constituted 0.2 to 2gkg−1of PM2.5
(ﬁneparticulatematterwithaerodynamicdiameter <2.5µm)
whichitselfwasformedwithanofEFof15–35gkg−1. Kim
et al. (2003) measured changes in PAH concentrations in
0–5cm soil after forest ﬁres at three sites in Korea. On
average, soil PAH concentrations (sum of the 16 US Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) priority PAHs, denoted
)Sigma116PAH) were 1200, 200 and 300 µgkg−1at one, ﬁve, and
nine months after ﬁre, compared to 50 µgkg−1in control
sites. The decline in the ﬁrst few months was attributed to
loss of ash by wind and rain erosion. The same 16 PAHs
were determined in 0–10cm soils of the Swiss soil moni-
toring network (Bucheli et al., 2004), with median )Sigma116PAH
values increasing in the order of arable soils (66 µgkg−1),
grassland and pasture (142 µgkg−1), forests (164 µgkg−1)
and urban soils (451 µgkg−1). Wilke and Amelung (2000)
foundsimilarvaluesforthesumof20PAHsinNorthAmer-
ican native grassland sites (63–321 µgkg−1). No data were
located in a literature search for information on PAHs in bo-
real forest soils, but these surveys indicate the general range
that could be expected under natural conditions.
There is an interaction of PyC and PAHs in the envi-
ronment; not only are they co-produced but compared to
non-pyrogenic OM in soils and sediments, BC has a much
higherabilitytoadsorbPAHsandotherhydrophobicorganic
compounds. This has been the subject of much recent re-
search, especially concerning the fate and bioavailability of
these compounds in BC-containing harbour sediments (e.g.,
Accardi-DeyandGeschwend,2003;Cornelissenetal.,2005;
Jonker et al., 2005; Lohmann et al., 2005). Laboratory-
produced biomass chars (Chun et al., 2004; Zhu and Pig-
natello, 2005) also showed high afﬁnity for aromatic com-
pounds, depending on the degree of carbonization and oxy-
genloss. TheinﬂuenceofsoilandsedimentBConthefateof

5 Characteristics and stocks of soil PyC
5.1 How ﬁre affects soil properties and development
In addition to obvious charring or increases in chemically-
deﬁned BC, ﬁre causes other general changes in soil organic
matter (SOM) properties, and wider-ranging effects on soil
development, although the information available is mainly
from grasslands and agriculture in temperate and tropical
regions. As recently reviewed (Certini, 2005; Gonz ´alez-
P´erez et al., 2004), the effects of ﬁre on soil organic mat-
ter (SOM) include a relative decrease in the proportion of
humic acid (the fraction obtained by extraction with base
and subsequent precipitation with acid), with increase in the
insoluble humin fraction. There is a loss of carbohydrates
and oxygen-containing functional groups. The proportion of
alkylCmayincrease,andthisisoftenassociatedwithdevel-
opment of hydrophobicity in the upper mineral soil, which
contributes to soil erosion, landslides and ﬂooding in moun-
tainous territory (Neary et al., 1999; DeBano, 2000). The
lossofcarbohydrates(indicatedbyreductionofO-alkylCin
the13C NMR spectra) also contributes to loss of aggregate
stability(Kavdiretal.,2005). Thus,ﬁregenerallycausesthe
remaining organic matter to become less soluble and more
resistant to oxidation and biological decomposition.
Charring often results in only small changes (Czimczik et
al., 2003; Knicker et al., 2005a) or a decrease (Baldock and
Smernik, 2002; Harden et al., 2004; Neff et al., 2005) in
the C/N ratio, and an increase in more recalcitrant organic N
forms (Gonz ´alez-P´erez et al., 2004; Castro et al., 2006). In
SOMunaffectedbyﬁre,15NNMRindicatesthatamideisthe
predominant form of soil N, whereas an increase of pyrrole-
typeNisfoundinﬁre-affectedsoils,andhasbeensuggested
as a molecular marker of ﬁre (Knicker et al., 2005a).
Reported effects of charring on δ13C are generally small
and somewhat erratic (Bird and Gr ¨ocke, 1997; Czimczik
et al., 2002; Rumpel et al., 2006). With increasing ther-
mal alteration, biomass should become isotopically lighter
with preferential loss of cellulose, and greater contribution
of more-depleted lignin to formation of condensed aromatic
structures, as was recently demonstrated for wood samples
(Turney et al., 2006). In general, char retains the signa-
ture of its C3 or C4 plant origin (Hiradate et al., 2004), al-
though much greater depletion has been observed for char
derived from some C4 grasses, especially for natural rather
than oxygen-limited laboratory burns (Turekian et al., 1998;
Krulletal.,2003). Measurementofchangesin δ13Cofatmo-
spheric CO 2is one of the approaches used to quantify CO 2
emissionsfromforestﬁres(Langenfeldsetal.,2002;Schuur
et al., 2003; Randerson et al., 2005).
There is increasing evidence that pyrogenic C can make
a substantial contribution to SOM in ﬁre-prone ecosystems,
and can inﬂuence pedogenesis. The isolation of highly aro-
matic humic acids from SOM has long been considered an
indicator of BC inputs (Haumaier and Zech, 1995; Golchinet al., 1997; Zech et al., 1997; Almendros et al., 2003; Ben-
ites et al., 2005), as is development of stable humus forms
highly resistant to decomposition (Almendros et al., 2003;
Benitesetal.,2005). Highlyaromatichumicacids(Shindoet
al., 1986; Hiradate et al., 2004) and charred plant fragments
constituting3–33%ofSOC(Shindoetal.,2004,2005)were
found in volcanic ash soils from Japanese grasslands subject
to frequent burning.
Charcoal inputs have been proposed to account for the
development of dark Chernozemic soils in the Canadian
prairies (Ponomarenko and Anderson, 2001), and the Rus-
siansteppe(Rodionovetal.,2006)andalsothepatchy,relict
Chernozems in Europe, especially where there were Ne-
olithicsettlements(Schmidetal.,2002;Schmidtetal.,2002;
Kleber et al., 2003). Black carbon is a deﬁning property of
theSouthAmericananthropogenicsoils( TerraPreta) devel-
oped by native populations before European contact. They
are dark in colour and still high in fertility compared to the
surroundinghighlyweatheredandinfertileOxisols(Glaseret
al., 2000, 2001, 2002). In the deep A horizons (40–80cm),
BC (BPCA method) typically constitutes 20% or more of
SOC.Ithasalsobeensuggestedthatpodzolizationprocesses
areinhibitedbyfrequentﬁresthatdestroytheforestﬂoorand
C available for translocation (Mokma and Vance, 1989), in-
cluding one study in Siberian Scots pine forest (Czimczik et
al., 2005).
5.2 Quantitative analysis of PyC – non-forest soils
Table 3a summarizes literature data for soil BC from mainly
non-forest sites, as percentage of total SOC if available.
None of these sites are boreal, but there are sufﬁcient data to
allow some comparison of results from different techniques.
The values obtained from photo-oxidation and13C NMR of
the<53µm fraction (Skjemstad et al., 1999a, 2002, 2004),
up to 35% of SOC, are in general higher than those from
other thermal and chemicalmeasures ofoxidation resistance
(Schmidt et al., 2001). Even higher-ranging values were
found by Ponomarenko and Anderson (2001), who deter-
mined BC by mass remaining after photo-oxidation. These
higher values are likely because the residues from photoox-
idation still contain other resistant or protected C structures
that can be distinguished by subsequent NMR analysis; also
some of the highest values (up to 80%) came from samples
withvisiblecharredparticlecontent. Generallylowerresults
(1.7–18%) were found using the BPCA method (Glaser and
Amelung,2003;Daietal.,2005;Rodionovetal.,2006),and
the lowest range (1-7%) by thermal and chemical oxidation
techniques (Bucheli et al., 2004; Rumpel et al., 2005).

5.3 PyC in forest soils
5.3.1 Qualitative characterization
Few studies have characterized the BC component of forest
soils,especiallyforborealregions. Solid-state13CNMRwas
usedtoelucidatechangesinorganicmattercompositionafter
wildﬁresinSpain(Knickeretal.,2005a)andTurkey(Kavdir
et al., 2005), and after prescribed ﬁre in eucalypt plantations
in Australia (Guinto et al., 1999). The general results are
similar to trends noted above (Sect. 5.1) and for a moorland
site (Haslam et al., 1998), mainly a relative decrease in O-
alkyl C and increase in alkyl and aromatic C. While individ-
ual charred particles may be very high in aromatic C, there
may actually be little change in aromatic C in bulk forest
ﬂoor or surface mineral horizons of ﬁre-affected sites. This
can be the case where organic matter is consumed by ﬁre,leaving ash rather than char, with little alteration of under-
lying material, or if new organic matter quickly accumulates
from the pulse of detritus from ﬁre-killed biomass and litter
from regrowing vegetation.
Preston et al. (2002b) found evidence for BC in coastal
temperate forest sites of southern Vancouver Island, British
Columbia. Solid-state13C NMR showed that several sam-
plesofthe2–8mmwater-ﬂoatablefractionfrommineralsoil
were high in aromatic C characteristic of BC; all of these
samples were from the drier east side of Vancouver Island,
where ﬁre was historically more prevalent than from the
cooler, wetter west coast.
Although sparse, information on boreal forests includes
two studies on the Boreal Forest Transect Case Study
(BFTCS) in northern Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Preston
et al. (2002a) separated mineral soil from two jack pine and

ples. Fortheblacksprucesite,thebroadaromaticpeakinthe
250–63 µm fraction of the A+B horizon also indicated pos-
sible incorporation of BC into mineral soil OM. In a survey
of forest ﬂoor chemistry along the BFTCS transect, Preston
et al. (2006) found high aromatic intensity from charcoal in
some of the samples from jack pine sites, but not from black
spruce sites. No attempt was made to quantify BC, as the
studies were not designed with this objective.

FIRE experimental burn study in black spruce in Alaska.
With burning, the proportion of mass loss at the ﬁrst peak
(280◦C) decreased and that at the second peak (400◦C) in-
creased, and there was lower total mass loss up to 1000◦C.
These changes indicate loss of labile C, mainly carbohy-
drates,andincreaseinligninand/orblackC.Similarchanges
in organic composition were found following wildﬁre in
Alaska (Neff et al., 2005). Although peatlands comprise
largeareasoftheborealforest,andarealsovulnerabletoﬁre
(Zoltaietal.,1998;BenscoterandWieder,2003;Turetskyet
al., 2004), we found no information on BC characteristics or
stocks. Analyses of char in peat proﬁles to investigate pale-
obotany and peat development (e.g., Kuhry, 1994; Laird and
Campbell,2000;Flanniganetal.,2001)arenotgenerallyde-
signed for this purpose.
As part of their studies of C cycling in the BOREAS Old
Black Spruce study area near Thompson Manitoba, Harden
etal.(1997)andTrumboreandHarden(1997)concludedthat
charred material was an important input to deep organic lay-
ers in black spruce-feathermoss. In a later study, Manies et
al. (2005)estimatedthat10to60%ofCindeeporganichori-
zons is derived from wood biomass, speciﬁcally from ﬁre-
killed trees (i.e., data were only used from buried wood with
evidence of charring). However, charcoal was not speciﬁ-
cally quantiﬁed in any of these three studies.
5.3.2 PyC in forest soils – quantitative analyses
Again, there are few studies from boreal regions. For stud-
ieslimitedtoorganichorizons,onlytwostudieswerefound,
based on visual assessment of charcoal (Table 3b). Higher
amounts (984–2074kgha−1)were found by Zackrisson et
al. (1996) in boreal Sweden than in the temperate Quebec
forest (343–1295kgha−1)by B´elanger et al. (2004 and per-
sonal communication). This is probably due to several fac-

tors, including low intensity of the ﬁre, low biomass of the
stands, and no quantiﬁcation of charcoal fragments smaller
than 2mm.
Studies of mineral soils and whole soil proﬁles can be di-
vided into those based on visual assessment of charcoal vs.
those using chemical analyses of BC. Carcaillet and Talon
(2001) determined charcoal stocks in soil proﬁles along al-
titudinal transects in dry valleys in the French Alps. In the
current conifer-dominated forest belt (1700 to 2200ma.s.l.)
charcoal C accounted for 0.1 to 20% of SOC, correspond-
ing to 10 to 30000kgha−1of charcoal. The high variability
likely resulted from both local spatial variation in fuel type
(e.g.,logvs.twigsorshrubs),andvariationinﬁrefrequency
throughout the Holocene.
A recent Australian study (Hopmans et al., 2005) pro-
duced high estimates of both charcoal generated in slash-
burning (Sect. 4.1.1, Table 1) and soil charcoal C stocks
(>2mm, to 30cm depth). Charcoal accounted for 15–32%
of total soil C, or 15000–140000kgha−1. A similar result
wasfoundforCorsicanforests,with9800to148000kgha−1
of soil charcoal (Carcaillet and Talon, 2001).
Three studies from Siberia determined BC by chemi-
cal methods. Two studies of Scots pine stands in Siberia
produced widely differing results. For a 215-y-old stand
(Schulze et al., 1999), BC determined by a thermal method
amounted to 20–24% of total C in forest ﬂoor plus 0-75
cm mineral soil, and 13% for 75–300cm. Using the BPCA
method, however, Czimczik et al. (2005) found much lower
soil BC stocks for a ﬁre chronosequence in the same study
area,with99%oftheBCfoundintheorganiclayer(Fig.5).
This study also suggested that BC could be lost in subse-
quentﬁres: forsiteswithlowﬁrefrequency,BCstocksinthe

organiclayerwereupto720kgha−1,butmuchlowervalues
(<50kgha−1)were found for stands subject to intense ﬁres
that had previously consumed the whole organic layer. A re-
centstudyofpermafrostsoilsfurthernorthalongtheYenisey
River found that BC was up to 5.7% of SOC (Rodionow et
al., 2006), using the BPCA method, but without multiplying
the BPCA yields by the the commonly-used factor of 2.27.
Estimates of PyC stocks as BC or charcoal are very lim-
ited, especially for boreal regions, and very difﬁcult to com-
pare, due to the variations of sampling and analysis. How-
ever, the estimates of forest ﬂoor charcoal stocks in the or-
der of 1000–2000kgha−1for boreal forest sites likely un-
derestimatetotalsitecharcoal,includingthatinmineralsoil,
coarse woody debris, and very ﬁne particles. For the min-
eralsoil/soilproﬁlestudiesusingchemicalmethods,withre-
sults available as percent of SOC, the value determined by
Schulze et al. (1999) may not be reliable, due to early de-
velopmentofthethermaloxidationmethod,andresultsfrom
only one proﬁle. For the other studies, generally higher val-
ues are found for charcoal C as percent of total SOC, rather
similar to those derived from photo-oxidation plus NMR for
the non-forest sites in Table 3a, while the two BPCA studies
produced lower results.
6 What happens to PyC?
6.1 Mechanisms for transformation and transport of PyC
Although PyC is generally assumed to be relatively inert
to degradation (especially the BC fraction that is oxidation-
resistant), it must degrade eventually (Schmidt and Noack,
2000). There is ample evidence that char, or highly aro-
matic carbon structures, are decomposed more slowly than
other plant residues. Studies of C-depleted plots from long-
term bare fallows showed that the remaining soil C was en-
riched in aromatic structures (Kiem et al., 2000). Similar
results were found in two Australian studies of agricultural
soils(Skjemstadetal.,1999b,2004). TheTerraPretaanthro-
pogenic soils of South America have retained their higher C
and BC contents centuries after being abandoned (Glaser et
al., 2001).
There is increasing evidence, however, that BC is suscep-
tibletolosses,especiallyoverlongertimescales. Onepossi-
ble mechanism for BC loss is oxidation by subsequent ﬁres.
Thishypothesishasnotyetbeentesteddirectly,butbasedon
measurements of charcoal production, stocks in forest ﬂoor,
and ﬁre return intervals, Ohlson and Tryterud (2000) con-
cluded that charcoal stocks in boreal forests should be ap-
proximately ten times higher than actually observed. To ex-
plain this discrepancy, they suggested that some charcoal is
consumed by subsequent ﬁres, a hypothesis also suggested
by Czimczik et al. (2005, Sect. 5.3.2).
Second,thereisevidencefortheroleofslowchemicalox-
idationandsolublizationofsoilBC,asalreadydemonstratedfor atmospheric BC (Decessari et al., 2002). The surfaces of
BC particles aged in soils for decades to millennia become
increasingly oxidized (Schmidt et al., 2002, Brodowski et
al.,2005b),characteristicallyexhibitingmorecarboxylicand
phenolic groups (Lehmann et al., 2005). Fourier-transform
ion-cyclotron-resonance mass spectrometry showed that a
humic acid from a dark Japanese soil with frequent burning
ofcropresidueswashighinheavily-carboxylated,hydrogen-
deﬁcient condensed aromatic structures, consistent with ox-
idized BC (Kramer et al., 2004). Oxidation increases water
solubility, and similar BC-derived structures have also been
detected in dissolved organic matter from the Delaware and
Amazon River systems (Kim et al., 2004), and from a ﬁre-
affected forest soil (Hockaday et al., 2006).
Third,pyrogeniccarbonissusceptibletobiologicaldegra-
dation. Even graphite is not immune, with 2% oxidation re-
ported for a 96-day incubation of artiﬁcial graphite in soil
(Shneour, 1966). Other incubation studies are discussed in
Sect. 6.2. Compared to the PyC formed from fossil fuel
combustion, however, PyC formed from biomass burning
has a relatively low degree of thermal transformation (Fer-
nandes et al., 2003; Knicker et al., 2005b), with higher po-
larity, and small and less-ordered aromatic regions. Simi-
lar to laboratory-produced chars from wood (Baldock and
Smernik, 2002; Czimczik et al., 2002), BC found in boreal
forest ﬂoor after wildﬁre had small cluster size with many
functional groups (Czimczik et al., 2003). Such PyC would
probably fall in the intermediate region termed charcoal in
Fig. 1. Small cluster size combined with a relatively high
degree of functionalization would probably make these par-
ticles more susceptible to chemical degradation than more
highly condensedstructures. Finally,PyCis also susceptible
tophysicalfragmentationandtransportfromitssiteoforigin
(Sects. 6.4, 6.5).
6.2 Incubation studies
The few incubation studies show very low rates of de-
composition in a laboratory setting. Shindo (1991) used
charred plant residues from an experimental ﬁre in a grass-
land (mainly Miscanthus sinensis A.), and qualitatively re-
ported hardly any decomposition after 40 weeks incubation
in volcanic ash soil. Baldock and Smernik (2002) used red
pine(Pinusresinosa )woodcharredatdifferenttemperatures.
After120daysincubationinsand,20%ofCwasmineralized
from wood heated at 70◦C (essentially unaltered). Carbon
mineralization decreased to 13% for wood heated to 150◦C,
and to less than 2% for chars produced at 200–350◦C, with
increasing proportions of aromatic C. Incubation of wheat
and rice chars (produced at 350◦C for 2h) w ith soil and
quartz showed a rapid initial loss of 5–50% of the initial BC
(determinedbytheBPCAmethod)withintheﬁrst6months,
but this levelled off in the following 1.5 years (Brodowski,
2004). No changes in BC content were found in the sterile

controls, consistent with microbial rather than abiotic pro-
cesses.
The importance of an additional source of more readily-
available C (co-metabolism) for the breakdown of PyC was
shown by Hamer et al. (2004), in a study of charred maize
(Zea mays L.), rye (Secale cereale L.) and oak wood incu-
bated in sand for 60 days. For the charred substrates, carbon
mineralization of 0.3%–0.8% was increased to 0.6%–1.2%
by glucose additions at 0 and 26 days. However, glucose
mineralization was also enhanced by addition of charcoal,
suggestingthatitshighsurfaceareaandporousstructuremay
promotegrowthofmicroorganisms. Similareffectshavealso
been found in ﬁeld studies, as discussed in Sect. 7.2. Hamer
et al. (2004) suggested that small molecules may not be sta-
bilized by sorption into charcoal pores, but could actually
become even more susceptable to microbial activity.
The possibilities for microbial degradation of charred
biomass are likely to be similar to those occurring in for-
est sites that have shown microbial utilization of C from lig-
nite combustion ash (Machulla et al., 2004), and from lig-
nite in soils developed after open-pit coal mining (Rumpel
and K¨ogel-Knabner, 2002, 2004). The latter studies also
showed increasing oxidative transformation of lignite into
humicacidsandtheimportanceofco-metabolismfordecom-
position of lignite.
6.3 Information from degradation of geological and sedi-
mentary substrates
Studies using a variety of techniques indicate that the resis-
tance of BC and char to mineralization is relative, and while
the rates may be slow, they appear to be affected by simi-
lar factors that inhibit or enhance loss of other organic sub-
strates. The results of short-term incubations would mainly
represent the less-condensed fraction, so rates would be ex-
pected to decline with time. However, most incubation stud-
iesmeasuredecompositionbyCO 2evolution,andespecially
in the short term would not capture incomplete oxidation of
BC and its incorporation into SOM. Additionally, decom-
position in ﬁeld settings could be enhanced by other factors
suchasphotooxidation,leaching,andvariableavailabilityof
nutrientsandmorereadily-availableC.Whilethesehavenot
been investigated for charcoal and BC in forest or peatland
settings, some information can be gathered from studies of
other recalcitrant organic substrates such as coal, shale and
kerogen.
At geological timescales, chemical weathering of ancient
organic matter plays a role in the global C cycle. These
slow processes consume oxygen, release CO 2, and gener-
atedissolvedandsolidoxidationproducts(Mackenzieetal.,
2004a). Recent studies of coal (Chang and Berner, 1998,
1999) and black shale (Petch et al., 2000, 2001) have high-
lighted the importance of contact with oxgyen-rich surface
waters. The laboratory coal oxidation studies of Chang
and Berner (1998, 1999) show that while chemical oxida-tion rates are low, they are signiﬁcant on a geological time
scale. Chang and Berner (1999) estimated lifetimes of 8000
and 80000y for coal with grain sizes of 10 µm and 100
µm diameter, respectively. The coal and shale studies also
showthatCO 2productionaccountsforonly30–50%ofoxy-
gen consumption, with the rest producing partially oxidized
solids and a small fraction of DOC. Thus similar to aging
of PyC in soil, the residues become enriched in oxygen-
containing functional groups such as carboxylic acid, esters,
aldehydes and ketones, enhancing their water-solubility and
initiating their transfomation into humic fractions of SOM.
Keller and Bacon (1998) determined that Cretaceous-age till
kerogen in the vadose zone would be consumed in 10000y
or less with oxygen exposure.
Results in the same range have been found for loss of BC
in ocean sediments. Middelburg et al. (1999) estimated 64%
BC degradation in marine sediments with 10–20ky of oxy-
gen exposure. By comparing radiocarbon ages of BC and
concurrently deposited non-BC organic matter Masiello and
Druffel (1998, 2003) estimated BC residence times of 2400
to 13 900y with oxygen exposure. Recalcitrant substrates
such as coal, shale, kerogen and BC in sediments can be ox-
idized in the order of 10–20ky, and similar results might be
expected for the more recalcitrant PyC from forest ﬁres, de-
pending on structure and oxygen exposure.
6.4 Movement and fragmentation of PyC
There is much evidence for fragmentation and movement
of PyC down into mineral horizons, although most is from
non-boreal regions. Movement of ﬁne char particles or BC
down through mineral soil was demonstrated for sugar cane
ﬁeldsinAustralia(Skjemstadetal.,1999b),nativegrassland
in Texas (Dai et al., 2005), slash-and-burn soils in Thailand
(Rumpel et al., 2006), and steppe soils of Russia (Rodionov
et al., 2006). As noted previously, Ponomarenko and An-
derson(2001)foundhighproportionsofcharcoalCinaspen

ile combustion products of herbaceous plants compared to

Little information is available for forested regions, al-
though some studies have been undertaken to deal with the
effects of charcoalmovement on reconstruction of Holocene
vegetation and disturbance regimes. For an altitudinal tran-
sect in the French Alps, Carcaillet (2001a, 2001b) showed
thatfragmentationbyfreeze-thawprocesses,bioturbationby
soil fauna, and proﬁle disturbancebytree uprooting andsur-
face erosion following ﬁres all contribute to downward mi-

charcoal mass was buried at a depth of 40–70cm for eleva-
tions below 2000m.”
Tree uprooting was considered to be the main cause of
charcoalmovementforacoastaltemperaterainforestofVan-
couver Island (Clayoquot River watershed), where cryotur-
bation,bioturbationandlandslideswereofminorimportance
(Gavin, 2003; Gavin et al., 2003). Figure 6 from Gavin
(2003) shows how charcoal could be transported from or-
ganic to mineral horizons from ﬁres at 2500y and 1500y
before present. The importance of charcoal burial by tree
uprooting also shown by Talon et al. (2005), who used the
charcoal fragments in podzolic soils to reconstruct ﬁre his-
tory in an old-growth deciduous forest in southern Qu ´ebec.
On steeper slopes of British Columbia interior rainforest,
charcoal is transported and buried mainly by shallow earth
landslides resulting from loss of root strength after wildﬁres
(Sanbornetal.,2006). A recentstudyofAlaskansoils(Ping
et al., 2005) noted that charcoal particles typically accumu-
lated at the base of the O horizon, and throughout the A and
upper B horizons, and that proﬁle development can be inﬂu-
enced by geliﬂuction and cyroturbation. Therefore, charcoal
movementandfragmentationinborealregionsmayoccurby
severalmechanisms,includingtreeuprooting,masswasting,
geliﬂuction and cryoturbation.
6.5 Transfer of PyC to marine sediments
For even the most recalcitrant organic substrates, the only
long-termshelterfrommineralizationisburialinanoxicma-
rine sediments which accumulate one mole of organic C for
every500–1000ﬁxedbyphotosynthesis(HedgesandOades,
1997). PyC is delivered by atmospheric deposition, and dis-solved, colloidal and particulate organic matter of rivers to
marine sediments, where it constitutes up to one-third of
organic C (Gustafsson and Gschwend, 1998; Masiello and
Druffel, 1998, 2001; Middelburg et al., 1999; Mitra et al.,
2002; Golding et al., 2004). In addition to BC from biomass
combustion, sedimentary BC includes petrogenic graphite
(GBC) which can be weathered out of rock, transported
and reburied in ocean sediments (Dickens et al., 2004a, b)
and soot from fossil fuel combustion (Masiello and Druffel,
2003).
Pyrogenicorganicmatteranditsbreakdownproductshave
been suspected to be exported from boreal forests to rivers
and ultimately to the Arctic Ocean (Schmidt, 2004). For es-
tuarine sediments in the Siberian Arctic, the proportion of
BC (chemothermal oxidation method) increased from 1%
to 15% of TOC from west to east (Guo et al., 2004). The
14C ages of sediment C also increased from 2570 to 13 050
yBP,supportingtheidea thatBC ismore resistant thanother
soil organic carbon. It appeared that the BC was mostly de-
rived from old organic matter released by permafrost thaw
and riverbank and coastal erosion, rather than recent forest
ﬁres. For the Canadian Arctic, G ˜oni et al. (2005) found that
ancient organic C (radiocarbon age exceeding 7000y) ac-
countedfor ∼70%oftheparticulateorganicmatterdelivered
by the Mackenzie River to the Mackenzie Delta/Beaufort
Shelf region. It was suggested to originate from a combi-
nation of fossil C (bitumen and/or kerogen) eroding from
sedimentary rocks, and old soil C released from permafrost
deposits. Itispossiblethattheformercategorycouldinclude
graphite, and the latter BC from ancient ﬁres, but certainly
data are lacking to assess the ﬂux of BC from boreal ﬁres to
Arctic sediments.
6.6 How long does PyC last in soils?
There is remarkably little ﬁeld data on the longevity of PyC
that is not consumed in a subsequent ﬁre, or transported
down through the soil proﬁle or off-site. Soils of temperate
rainforestsincoastalBritishColumbiacontaincharcoalfrag-
ments dating back to deglaciation, approximately 13000y
(Lertzmanetal.,2002). Foronesite,Gavinetal.(2003)plot-
ted charcoal mass vs. time since last ﬁre determined by14C
dating of individual charred particles, and found that char-
coalmassdecreasedexponentiallywithincreasingtimesince
thelastﬁre. Fromtheirdatawecalculateanaveragehalf-life
of 6623 years, assuming that all ﬁres initially produced sim-
ilar amounts of BC. This is similar to the time-scale for BC
loss in sediments, and for geological substrates, and also to
results for charcoal buried by landslides in interior British
Columbia (Sanborn et al., 2006). Soil charcoal radiocarbon
agesrangeduptonearly10000yBP,butonlyafewsamples

The rapid decomposition ( <100 years at 0–5cm) found
in Bird et al. (1999) could be due to higher temperatures,
goodaerationandstrongerphotooxidation,andalsobecause
char produced from savanna vegetation is ﬁner than from
wood. By contrast, in the British Columbia studies (Gavin
et al., 2003; Sanborn et al., 2006), decomposition would be
much slower due to colder temperatures, larger size of char
fragments produced from wood, burial in soil and moss lay-
ers, and especially in coastal sites, wet conditions in winter.
Evenslowerdecompositionmaybeexpectedincolderboreal
forests, especially for poorly-drained sites, and permafrost-
affected soils (Rodionow et al., 2006). Except for anoxic
peats or permanently frozen soil, the high end for the half-
life of PyC may be expected to be in the kY region (maybe
5–7ky), for cold, wet environments, and for the PyC frac-
tion with more recalcitrant structure. At the other extreme,
a half-life in the order of 100y (Bird et al., 1999) may be
not unrealistic for some fraction of PyC from boreal wild-
ﬁre, with less thermal alteration and especially with surface
exposure(unpublishedﬁeldobservationsfromCanadianand
Siberian boreal forest sites).
7 Towards understanding and quantifying the PyC cy-
cle in boreal regions
7.1 How much PyC is produced in boreal regions?
Kuhlbusch and Crutzen (1995) estimated annual release of
90–180TgC as CO 2-C from boreal and temperate ﬁres. Us-
ing their BC/CO 2-C ratio of 5–7% for boreal and temper-
ate forest ﬁres gives a range of 4.6–12.6TgBCy−1. Lynch
et al. (2004) calculated fuel consumption and charcoal pro-
duction for the boreal regions of Canada and Alaska for
1959–1995, based on 2% conversion of fuel mass to char-
coal mass (Sect. 4.1.1). For Canada, fuel consumption
was 46.86Tgy−1, resulting in 0.94Tg charcoal annually.
For Alaska, fuel consumption was 8.51Tgy−1, correspond-
ing to 0.17 Tg charcoal. Assuming charcoal C concentra-
tion of 700gCkg−1gives 0.66Tg charcoal C for Canada
and 0.12Tg charcoal C for Alaska, totaling production of
0.78TgCy−1as charcoal particles that were airborne at
some point during the ﬁre.
Comparison is difﬁcult because of the different methods
andapproaches. KuhlbuschandCrutzen(1995)deﬁneBCas
C remaining after pre-extraction and chemical oxidation. It
wouldbeexpectedthatproductionofthisoxidation-resistant
BCfractionwouldbelowerthanconversiontoCasvisually-
determinedchar. However,the5–7%ratioofBC/CO 2-Ccor-
respondstotheupperrangeofcharCyield(Table1). Onthe
other hand, the 2% mass conversion reported by Lynch et
al. (2004) is probably low, as it only includes charcoal parti-
cles collected in surface traps.
Kasischke et al. (2005) recently modeled boreal ﬁre emis-
sions for 1992, and 1995–2003, including detailed con-sideration of ﬂaming vs. smouldering combustion stages,
and extent of forest ﬂoor consumption. For the whole
high Northern Hemisphere (HNH), emissions were 162.9,
225.8 and 265.5TgC y−1for low-, moderate- and high-
severity ﬁre scenarios, respectively, based on depth of
forest ﬂoor consumption. For Canada, the correspond-
ing emissions were 35.3, 58.2 and 64.1TgCy−1. Com-
bining the emissions range from Kasischke et al. (2005),
with a general estimate of 90% conversion of C to CO 2
and 5–7% BC/CO 2-C (Kuhlbusch and Crutzen, 1995), re-
sults in 7.3–16.7TgBCy−1from ﬁres in the HNH, and
1.6 to 4.0TgCy−1for Canada. Using the more conserva-
tive 46.86Tg estimate of annual boreal fuel consumption in
CanadafromLynchetal.(2004),andassuming500gCkg−1
in fuel, 90% conversion of C to CO 2, and 5–7% BC/CO 2-C
results in 1.2 to 1.6TgBCy−1. This is in the low range pre-
dictedbyKasischkeetal.(2005),buthigherthanthe0.66Tg
charcoalCcalculatedabove,using2%conversionofmassto
charcoal. This is mainly due to higher consumption of for-
estﬂoorintheworkofKasischkeetal.(2005),especiallyby
smouldering combustion.
Further reﬁnements of these estimates are really beyond
the scope of this review, and our expertise. These prelim-
inary estimates, however, provide a starting point to con-
sider the signiﬁcance of BC as a component of the very sta-
ble soil C pool. Recently modeled estimates of soil C for
north of 50 degrees (White et al., 2005) were 514PgC for
forestsandpeatlandsand26PgCforgrasslands,plusanother
230PgCfortundra,totaling870PgC.Bhattietal.(2003)re-
port 207PgC in boreal forest soil and detritus plus 415PgC
for peat, totaling 622PgC. For Canada, the amounts were
65PgC in forest soil and detritus, and 113PgC in peat. Bo-
realproductionoftheorderof7to17TgBCy−1istherefore
a small input to some global 600PgC in boreal forest, peat-
land and grassland soils. However, much of the soil C in
borealregionsisinpoorly-decomposedforestﬂoorandpeat,
protected from rapid decomposition mainly by environmen-
tal conditions of cold, waterlogging or permafrost (e.g., Pre-
ston et al., 2006; Harden et al., 1997). Future predictions of
warmertemperatures,lowerprecipitation,lossofpermafrost,
and increased ﬁre could enhancesoilanddetrital Closs,and
increasetherelativeimportanceoftheBCsink. Itwouldalso
beusefultoconsiderannualborealBCproductioninrelation
to detrital inputs, in particular, that proportion of detrital C
transferred to more stable soil pools.
7.2 How do ﬁre, charcoal and vegetation inﬂuence boreal
forest soil function?
In addition to the general effects of ﬁre on SOM discussed
earlier, there are interacting effects of ﬁre, charcoal and veg-
etation in boreal forests. In some boreal ecosystems, stands
that have not experienced ﬁre for many years develop thick
forest ﬂoor derived from feathermoss (mainly Pleurozium
schreberi); over time there is increasing cover of ericaceous

with N increasingly sequestered in poorly-available organic
forms. Ericaceous species are better able to utilize or-
ganic N (Read et al., 2004; Treseder et al., 2004), and late-
successional increase in N-ﬁxation by feathermoss in asso-
ciation with cyanobacteria may mainly beneﬁt ground veg-
etation rather than trees (Zackrisson et al., 2004). Decom-
position is further impeded by lower growing-season tem-
peratures in the thick feathermoss layer, and sometimes by
excessive moisture, with development of impermeable lay-
ers or sphagnum growth and incipient peat proﬁle develop-
ment. Fire consumes the insulating moss layer, producing
warmer surface soil temperatures, and increasing the depth

plants improves germination and growth of tree seedlings.
These general concepts of the role of ﬁre in ecosystem func-
tion have been developed through many studies, notably of
black spruce in North America (Richter et al., 2000; Kasis-
chke and Johnstone, 2005), and Norway spruce ( Picea abies
(L.) Karst.) and Scots pine in Scandinavia (DeLuca et al.,
2002; Zackrisson et al., 1996, 2004). A similar trajectory
of ecosysem development after ﬁre was found for conifer
forests in Montana (MacKenzie et al., 2004b, 2006).
Nitrogen losses from ﬁre are highly variable and soil N
may even increase from inputs of canopy necromass (Dry-
ness et al., 1989; Harden et al., 2004). As discussed earlier,
ﬁre generally reduces the biological availability of organic
N.However,thermalammoniﬁcationoforganicN,increased

putsoffreshlykilledlittermayresultinincreasedavailability

4for 2–5y (Choromanska and DeLuca, 2002).In addition to direct effects of ﬁre on forest soils and veg-
etation succession, Zackrisson et al. (1996) proposed that
charcoal in boreal forests may itself inﬂuence microbial ac-
tivity and nutrient cycling in soils. This mainly derives from
its porous structure that can sorb organic molecules and pro-
vide microbial habitat (Harvey et al., 1976; Pietik ¨ainen et
al., 2000; Hamer et al., 2004). Charcoal produced from
laboratory heating of twigs and stems adsorbed phenolics
and reduced their phytotoxic effects on germination (Zack-
rissonetal.,1996; Keechetal.,2005),andincreasedgrowth
of birch ( Betula pendula ) seedlings in pots (Wardle et al.,
1998). However studies using activated carbon (Wallstedt et
al., 2002; Naydenov et al., 2006) produced less clear ben-
eﬁts to seedling germination and growth. Increased nitriﬁ-
cation was found with addition of wildﬁre-produced char-
coal (DeLuca et al., 2006) and with activated carbon, al-
though results for ﬁeld studies were weaker than for labora-
toryincubations(DeLucaetal.,2002;Berglundetal.,2004).
This is likely because charcoal addition is not a complete
surrogate for the effects of ﬁre on soil, and also, activated
charcoal has different physical and chemical characteristics,
mainlymuchhighersurfaceareathanwildﬁre-orlaboratory-
produced chars (Brown et al., 2006; Hille and den Ouden,
2005). It also appears that the sorptive power of wildﬁre-
producedcharcoalpersistsuptoaround100y(Zackrissonet
al., 1996).
Apart from these speciﬁc studies of boreal and temper-
ate forest soils, charcoal amendment has been associated
with general improvement and sustainability of soil fertil-
ityinﬁre-pronenativegrasslandsitesintheNorthAmerican
GreatPlains(GlaserandAmelung,2003),andfromcharcoal
amendmentoftropicalsoils(Glaseretal.,2000,2001,2002;

7.3 The boreal PyC cycle – ﬁlling the knowledge gaps
Figure7showsourinitialviewoftheBCcycle,onaCbasis,
with many question-marks. Fuel conversion to solid char in
forest ﬁres is probably in the range of 1–3% on a C basis,
although higher values around 8–10% may be found where
there are large stocks of coarse woody debris. Conversion
to volatile soot is much lower, around 0.1–0.4% of fuel C,
and deposition data are lacking. The solid char may be con-
sumed in a subsequent ﬁre, or slowly lost by photochemical,
chemical and biological oxidation, whose rates and mecha-
nismsarepoorlyknown. PartiallydegradedandmodiﬁedBC
structuresarelikelytocontributetoDOC,andtoCdeposited
in ocean sediments. As part of SOM, the more labile char
may turn over within tens or hundreds of years, whereas the
lessdegradableandbetter-protectedPyCmayrequireseveral

millenia. The persistance of char and BC is affected by sim-
ilar factors as other forms of SOM. First, its recalcitrance to
oxidativedegradationincreaseswith increasinglycondensed
polyaromatic structures with lower H/C and O/C ratios, and
in particular with increasing soot content (Elmquist et al.,
2006). Second, it appears that BC can become stabilized by
association with mineral particles, and third, persistence is
enhanced by colder and less-oxic conditions, so that BC is
well-preserved in peat bogs and sediments. For boreal re-
gions, there are essentially no direct ﬁeld measurements of
the turnover time or rates of PyC loss by chemical, biologi-
cal,thermalorphotochemicaloxidation,orquantitativestud-
ies of its movement. These are obviously key requirements
for modeling the PyC cycle in boreal regions, especially its
role as a long-term sink of stable soil C. However, the data
gathered from other regions on PyC loss and transformation
should provide reasonable expectations of its behaviour for
boreal regions.
While analytical problems persist, and methodologies for
BC are still under intense development and discussion, this
should not be an impediment to acquiring some basic infor-
mationonPyCinborealregions,especiallyasrequiredforC
budget modelling. Techniques for visual assessment of char
are well-established, but there appear to be no studies with
a complete accounting of char in any boreal forest site, and
we found no quantitative information on BC storage in bo-
real peatlands. Integrated projects and interdisciplinary ap-
proaches are required, so that, for example, measurements
of PyC production could be integrated into experimental ﬁre
studies such as the ICFME (Stocks et al., 2004) and FIRE
BEAR (Samsonov et al., 2005), and the painstaking efforts
to assess char abundance in peat cores could also be used to
developestimatesofarea-basedcharstocks. Increasedappli-
cation of14C dating is also necessary to assess the turnover
time of different fractions of PyC. Char height on stems has
been used to predict tree mortality after ﬁre (H ´ely et al.,
2003), and there areassessments of stocks ofdownedcoarse
woody debris and snags in Canadian boreal regions (Lee,
1998; Greif and Archibold, 2000; Pedlar et al., 2002), but
only one study (Manies et al., 2005) has linked ﬁre-killed
wood (but not wood-associated char) to soil C storage.
Analysis of BC by thermal or chemical oxidation resis-
tance, BPCA production or photochemical oxidation plus
NMR is expensive and time-consuming, and it is unlikely
thatanyonemethodwillprovesuitableforallsamples. Valu-
able information has come from the BC comparative anal-
ysis ring trial (Hammes et al., 2006b1). Urgently needed
are rapid and inexpensive analytical tools capable to analyze
large numbers of char and BC produced in boreal ﬁres. It
would also be useful to develop more capacity for routine
analysis of H concentration as well as C, as the H/C ratio
is a good indicator of aromatic condensation. Radiocarbon
dating of char fragments and soil fractions is essential to un-
derstanding the long-term sink potential of BC, including its
contribution to marine sediments.Efforts should be made to acquire more ﬁeld data on pro-
ductionandstocksofvisually-deﬁnedcharinborealregions,
while analysing a subset of samples for BC by several meth-
ods. This approach should allow development of a two-
component model for PyC, and a conversion factor to esti-
mate what fraction of visually-determined char has the more
recalcitrant structures that will likely contribute to a long-
lasting BC sink. For mineral soils, char may be less visi-
ble and chemical and spectroscopic methods essential to as-
sessadequatelytheBCcontributiontoSOM.Informationon
the atmospheric component is also inadequate, and requires
measurement and tracking of volatile C emission from ﬁres,
andmonitoringofatmosphericBCconcentrationsanddepo-
sition rates.
Despite the impact of wildﬁre in boreal regions, there
has been little study of stocks, production, characteristics or
longevityofBCinborealforestsandevenlessforpeatlands.
We still lack much basic information required to assess the
role of BC as a C sink in boreal forest soils and Arctic sed-
iments, or whether it substantively inﬂuences soil processes
by sorption of phenolics and provision of microbial habitat.
It seems equally urgent to quantify boreal soot production,
transport, and potential for atmospheric warming.

Abstract Black carbon (BC) aerosol emitted by boreal ﬁres has the potential to accelerate losses of snow
and ice in many areas of the Arctic, yet the importance of this source relative to fossil fuel BC emissions fromlower latitudes remains uncertain. Here we present measurements of the isotopic composition of BC andorganic carbon (OC) aerosols collected at two locations in interior Alaska during the summer of 2013, as part
of NASA ’s Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment. We isolated BC from ﬁne air particulate matter
(PM
2.5) and measured its radiocarbon ( Δ14C) content with accelerator mass spectrometry. We show that ﬁres
were the dominant contributor to variability in carbonaceous aerosol mass in interior Alaska during thesummer by comparing our measurements with satellite data, measurements from an aerosol network andpredicted concentrations from a ﬁre inventory coupled to an atmospheric transport model. The Δ
14Co f
BC from boreal ﬁres was 131 ± 52 ‰in the year 2013 when the Δ14C of atmospheric CO 2was 23 ± 3 ‰,
corresponding to a mean fuel age of 20 years. Fire-emitted OC had a similar Δ14C (99 ± 21 ‰) as BC, but
during background (low ﬁre) periods OC (45 to 51 ‰) was more positive than BC ( /C0354 to /C057‰). We also
analyzed the carbon and nitrogen elemental and stable isotopic composition of the PM 2.5. Fire-emitted
aerosol had an elevated carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio (29 ± 2) and δ15N (16 ± 4 ‰). Aerosol Δ14C and δ13C
measurements were consistent with a mean depth of burning in organic soil horizons of 20 cm (and a range
of 8 to 47 cm). Our measurements of ﬁre-emitted BC and PM 2.5composition constrain the end-member of
boreal forest ﬁre contributions to aerosol deposition in the Arctic and may ultimately reduce uncertainties
related to the impact of a changing boreal ﬁre regime on the climate system.
1. Introduction
Black carbon (BC) aerosol is a major climate forcing agent [ Hansen et al ., 2000; Jacobson , 2001; Ramanathan
and Carmichael , 2008]. A recent assessment suggests that BC is the second most important climate warming
agent in the present atmosphere after CO 2, with a total radiative forcing of about 1.1 W m/C02[Bond et al .,
2013]. BC originates from incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels and contributes directly to
atmospheric warming by absorbing and scattering solar radiation [ Penner , 1995; Liousse et al ., 1996; Myhre
et al., 2013]. Combined with organic carbon (OC) and other aerosol types, BC also in ﬂuences climate by means
of semidirect and indirect effects on clouds [ Ackerman et al ., 2000; Lohmann and Feichter , 2005; Cozic et al .,
2007; Spracklen et al ., 2008; Bauer et al ., 2010; Koch and Del Genio , 2010; Ghan et al ., 2012; Ward et al ., 2012;
Tosca et al ., 2014].
Within the Arctic, warming from BC aerosols is ampli ﬁed by deposition on snow and ice surfaces, which
reduces surface albedo, increases surface solar heating, and accelerates snow and ice melt [ Wiscombe and
Warren , 1980; Flanner et al ., 2007, 2009; Hadley and Kirchstetter , 2012; Lee et al ., 2013; Jiao et al ., 2014].
Several modeling studies have attempted to quantify the radiative forcing of BC on snow and ice [ Flanner
et al., 2007, 2009; Koch et al ., 2009; Skeie et al ., 2011; Wang et al ., 2011]. In a metaanalysis, Bond et al . [2013]
estimated that the BC snow and ice albedo forcing for the industrial era (1750 –2005) is 0.13 W m/C02with a
90% uncertainty range of 0.04 to 0.33. Because of strong local albedo feedbacks from melting, the ef ﬁcacy
of the BC snow and ice albedo forcing (i.e., the associated change in equilibrium global mean temperature

[Hansen and Nazarenko , 2004; Flanner et al ., 2007]. Thus, mitigating BC emissions may be important in slowing
the observed rapid rate of Arctic warming [ Quinn et al ., 2008; Penner et al ., 2010]. Two important questions
remain with respect to the design of effective mitigation policy for BC: (1) What is the relative contributionofﬁre and fossil sources to BC deposition in different parts of the Arctic? and (2) How will climate change
modify these sources, thus contributing to positive or negative feedbacks?
Measurements of BC in arctic snow indicate that boreal forest ﬁre emissions can be an important component
of the deposition ﬂux, based on the signature of covarying tracers and optical properties [ Hegg et al ., 2009,
2010; Doherty et al ., 2010]. Chemical signatures of boreal forest ﬁre emissions have been preserved in
Greenland ice records [ McConnell et al ., 2007], and there is some evidence that widespread surface melt
events cooccur with deposition of BC from ﬁres [Keegan et al. , 2014]. Boreal ﬁres can release a large amount
of radiative energy [ Levine and Cofer , 2000; Val Martin et al ., 2010], leading to the development of convective
smoke columns that often extend above the planetary boundary layer [ Fromm , 2005; Damoah et al ., 2006;
Kahn et al ., 2008; Val Martin et al ., 2010]. The injection of plumes into the free troposphere increases the like-
lihood of long-range transport [ Forster et al ., 2001; Turquety et al ., 2007; Chen et al ., 2009]. Modeling studies by
Stohl et al . [2006, 2013] indicate that during the summer, boreal forest ﬁres are the dominant source of BC in
the Arctic. Although atmospheric BC concentrations are much lower in summer compared to late winter and
early spring [ Sharma , 2004], deposition on snow and ice during summer months has a disproportionate in ﬂu-
ence on the surface radiation budget because of higher levels of downwelling shortwave radiation and theprevalence of strongly re ﬂective low-level stratus cloud decks [ Stohl et al ., 2006; Flanner et al ., 2007].
Flanner et al . [2007] estimated that in a high boreal burning year (1998) about 35% of the total high-latitude
BC forcing was due to boreal ﬁres.
While it is clear that boreal forest ﬁres can signi ﬁcantly contribute to the BC transported into the Arctic, cur-
rent estimates of boreal ﬁre BC emissions remain uncertain and poorly constrained by measurements.
Bottom-up model estimates of carbon emissions are uncertain because of challenges in modeling fuel loads
and depth of burn (and thus fuel consumption) in organic soil layers of boreal forests [ French , 2004; Soja,
2004; Turetsky et al ., 2010; Rogers et al
., 2014; Veraverbeke et al ., 2015]. Emission factors of BC production
per unit of combusted biomass are known to vary as a function of fuel type, fuel moisture content, and ﬂam-
ing versus smoldering combustion phases, further increasing the range of possible estimates [ Reid et al .,
2005; Koch et al ., 2009; Akagi et al ., 2011; French et al ., 2011; Bond et al ., 2013; Yokelson et al ., 2013;
Kukavskaya et al ., 2013; Davis et al ., 2015]. Within the atmosphere, additional uncertainties are introduced
from dif ﬁculties in simulating BC aging, atmospheric transport, and rates of dry and wet deposition [ Croft
et al., 2005; Koch et al ., 2009; Xian et al ., 2009; Vignati et al ., 2010; Bond et al ., 2013].
Future changes in the boreal ﬁre regime have the potential to contribute to climate feedbacks [ Randerson
et al., 2006; Bonan , 2008; Bowman et al ., 2009; Rogers et al ., 2015] by affecting BC emissions and deposition
on snow, glaciers, sea ice, and ice sheets [ Hansen and Nazarenko , 2004; Flanner et al ., 2007; Ramanathan
and Carmichael , 2008; Stone et al ., 2008; Ward et al ., 2012; Marks and King , 2013] and by in ﬂuencing
atmospheric chemistry [ Levine and Cofer , 2000; Spracklen et al ., 2008; Palmer et al ., 2013] and surface
biophysics [ Liu, 2005; Amiro et al ., 2006; McGuire et al ., 2006; Liu and Randerson , 2008; Jin et al ., 2012; Oris
et al., 2014]. Fire frequency and intensity are projected to increase during the remainder of the 21st century
as a consequence of longer ﬁre seasons and larger vapor pressure de ﬁcits in the middle of the growing
season [ Amiro et al ., 2009; Balshi et al ., 2009; Euskirchen et al ., 2009; de Groot et al ., 2013; Flannigan et al .,
2013; Boulanger et al ., 2014]. The net effect of these changes on regional and global climate remains
uncertain and requires the development of new approaches for quantifying the strength of the various
feedback pathways.
Isotopic constraints on ﬁre and fossil fuel contributions have the potential to reduce uncertainties in the
partitioning of the total aerosol load, and thereby forcing, measured at remote locations, either in the atmo-
sphere [e.g., Wang et al ., 2011] or in snow [e.g., Hegg et al ., 2009, 2010]. The use of radiocarbon (14C) measure-
ments is a particularly effective approach because of the large contrast between fossil fuel (which is14C free)

directly measured and may not correspond to the value of contemporary atmospheric CO 2[Gustafsson et al .,
2009]. Aboveground thermonuclear weapons testing produced large quantities of14C in the 1950s and early
1960s causing a sudden twofold increase in the14C content of the Northern Hemisphere atmosphere
[Telegadas , 1971; Nydal and Lövseth , 1983]. Since the test cessation of aboveground weapons in 1963, the
14C/12C ratio of CO 2has gradually declined as a consequence of exchange with ocean and land reservoirs
and dilution by fossil fuel emissions [ Suess , 1955; Levin et al ., 2010]. The changing14C/12C ratio of the
atmosphere has led to a nonuniform and time-evolving labeling of terrestrial ecosystems as a consequence
of carbon ﬂow from the atmosphere through photosynthesis into plant, litter, and soil organic matter pools
that have widely varying turnover times [ Trumbore , 2000].
The heterogeneity of carbon ages within ecosystems makes it challenging to estimate the14C/12C ratio of
ﬁre-emitted aerosols. In boreal forests, further complications arise because organic soils have highly vari-
able14C/12C and are known to comprise the vast majority of carbon consumed by ﬁre [Dyrness and
Norum , 1983; Kasischke et al ., 1995; Rogers et al ., 2014]. The14C/12C ratio of organic soils increases with
depth because carbon farther from the surface is often older and thus was ﬁxed at a time when the
14C/12C of atmospheric CO 2was higher [ Trumbore and Harden , 1997; Carrasco et al ., 2006; Schuur and
Trumbore , 2006]. This pattern often reverses in deeper soil horizons where the carbon content originates
from plant ﬁxation prior to the bomb era and also from the cumulative effects of radioactive decay. As a
consequence of these vertical gradients, the14C/12C ratio of emissions is expected to be a nonlinear func-
tion of ﬁre severity.
Here we present results from direct measurement of BC and total carbon aerosol from wild ﬁres in interior
Alaska during the summer of 2013, collected as a part of NASA ’s Carbon in Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability
Experiment (CARVE). We isolated BC from ﬁne particulate matter (PM 2.5) using the Swiss_4S protocol
[Zhang et al ., 2012]. Improvements in the protocol described by Mouteva et al . [2015] allowed us to accurately
quantify the14C/12C ratio of the aerosol samples, along with uncertainties introduced from sample proces-
sing. We show that ﬁres were the dominant contributor to variability and aerosol mass in interior Alaska
during the summer of 2013 by combining our measurements with satellite observations and atmospheric
models. We ﬁnd that the14C/12C of BC aerosol during periods dominated by ﬁre emissions was considerably
higher than measurements from atmospheric CO 2at Point Barrow. Taking advantage of the synoptic-scale
temporal variability, we use a Keeling Plot approach to estimate the isotopic composition of the ﬁre aerosol
end-member. Additional aerosol and soil organic matter elemental and isotopic measurements indicate thataerosols provide information about the depth of burning in organic soils and that combustion and
atmospheric processing enrich the δ
15No f ﬁne particulate matter.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Sites
We collected aerosol samples at two locations in interior Alaska during the summer of 2013 (27 June to 10
August). One site was located at Caribou Poker Creek Long-Term Ecological Research Station (hereafterreferred to as “Caribou ”; 65.13°N, 147.45°W) and the other at Delta Junction Agricultural and Forestry
Experimental Site (hereafter “Delta ”; 63.97°N, 145.40°W). These two locations, separated by 168 km, were
selected to enable sampling of ﬁre-emitted aerosols in different areas of interior Alaska (Figure 1a).
To help relate carbonaceous aerosol measurements to soil emissions, we also analyzed a set of four soil pro-
ﬁles collected in August of 2012 in unburned (control) areas near the Gilles Creek ﬁre perimeter (C02: 64.33°N,
145.88°W; C04: 64.31°N, 145.94°W; C05: 64.32°N, 145.89°W; C06: 64.36°N, 145.58°W), described by Rogers et al .
[2014]. The Gilles Creek ﬁre burned during May of 2010 and covered 78.4 km
2. We chose to analyze soil cores
from four nearby control sites, representing the ecosystem types burned during the ﬁre. These included the
following: (1) lowland black spruce ( Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) underlain with permafrost, (2) lowland black
spruce without permafrost, (3) upland black spruce, and (4) mixed white spruce ( Picea glauca (Moench)
Voss) and aspen ( Populus tremuloides Michx.) forests.
2.2. Aerosol Sampling
We used high-volume total suspended particulate samplers (HIVOL-AMCLD, Thermo Environmental Instruments,
Franklin, MA, USA) with PM 2.5impactor plates (TE-230-QZ, Tisch Environmental, Cleves, OH, USA). The aerosolGlobal Biogeochemical Cycles 10.1002/2015GB005247

samplers were operated at a volumetric ﬂow rate of 1300 L min/C01to yield a PM 2.5sample on a 20 cm × 25 cm
quartz micro ﬁberﬁlter (2500 QAT-UP, Pall ﬂex Tissuquartz, Pall, Port Washington, NY, USA). Prior to use, sample
ﬁlters were prebaked at 500°C for 4 h, wrapped in aluminum foil and stored in sealed plastic bags to prevent
contamination. One slotted microquartz ﬁberﬁlter (TE-230-QZ, microquartz slotted collection substrates,
Tisch) was installed in the aerosol sampler impactor head per sampling period to remove particles with an
aerodynamic diameter greater than 2.5 μm. The impactor ﬁlters were only used for sizing, and were discarded
following sampling. A blank ﬁlter (1/4 of a prebaked sample ﬁlter) was mounted on the inside of each aerosol
sampler housing with no gas ﬂow during each sampling period to serve as blank for volatile organic carbon
take-up. After collection, sample ﬁlters and blanks were wrapped in aluminum foil, packed into airtight plastic
bags, and stored at /C020°C.

The 2013 ﬁre perimeters are shown in red and the 2010 Gilles Creek ﬁre is shown in blue. The ﬁre perimeter data were

within the perimeter of ﬁres reported in the AICC Large Fire Database. For the 11% that were not inside these perimeters,
most were located in close vicinity (within 1 km) of the perimeter edge.Global Biogeochemical Cycles 10.1002/2015GB005247

Atmospheric sampling intervals for individual ﬁlters ranged from 2 to 19 days (Table 2). The sampling time of
aerosol collection varied to allow accumulation of suf ﬁcient BC aerosol for14C analysis and was based on
visual inspection of the ﬁlter loading. We collected 14 aerosol samples: 8 at Caribou and 6 at Delta.
2.3. Sample Analyses
2.3.1. Isolation of BC From PM 2.5
To isolate and measure the BC content of each aerosol sample from the organic carbon (OC) fraction, we used
a thermo-optical OC/EC analyzer (Sunset Laboratory Inc., Tigard, OR, USA) with the “Swiss_4S ”thermal-optical
protocol [ Zhang et al ., 2012]. The Swiss_4S protocol enables physical separation of BC from the total carbo-
naceous aerosol with minimal contamination from nonsample carbon [ Zhang et al ., 2012; Mouteva et al .,
2015]. A simple and ef ﬁcient vacuum line was coupled to the OC/EC analyzer, allowing us to cryogenically
trap the evolving CO 2during the thermal-optical analysis for subsequent14C measurements [ Mouteva
et al ., 2015]. Aerosol ﬁlter samples were introduced into the OC/EC analyzer as 1.5 cm2ﬁlter punches
(1 cm × 1.5 cm) on a ﬂat quartz spoon. Punches were washed with Milli-Q water (Synergy 185, EMD
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) prior to analysis to remove water soluble OC and minimize charring.2.3.2. Δ
14C Analysis of Black Carbon in PM 2.5
The BC-derived CO 2was quanti ﬁed manometrically and sealed into a Pyrex ampoule. On another vacuum
line, the CO 2was converted to graphite using the hydrogen reduction method speci ﬁcally optimized for
ultrasmall samples [ Santos et al ., 2007]. The14C content of BC was measured via accelerator mass spectrome-
try (AMS) at the W. M. Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator Mass Spectrometry laboratory (KCCAMS) of UC Irvine,
alongside graphitization standards and blanks. We used the Δ14C notation ( ‰) for the presentation of our
results (equation (1)):

We applied14C corrections to account for carbon introduced during the analytical procedure using ﬁlter
blanks and14C measurements of BC reference materials [ Mouteva et al ., 2015]. For BC samples during high
ﬁre periods ( n= 6), the fraction of extraneous carbon mass added during the analysis procedure (and
corrected for) was 15 ± 9%. Note that due to the small sample size of BC aerosol (on the order of a fewTable 2. Elemental and Radiocarbon Analysis of Carbonaceous Aerosola

micrograms), even small amounts of extraneous carbon can signi ﬁcantly contribute to uncertainties in the
Δ14C measurement [ Mouteva et al ., 2015]. As a result, uncertainties reported below for the Δ14C of BC are
considerably larger than those for total carbon (TC).
2.3.3. Δ14C Analysis of Total Carbon in PM 2.5
Multiple punches ( n=2–18, based on carbon content) were taken from each sample and analyzed for the
Δ14C of the total carbon (TC) on the ﬁlter. The samples were sealed with CuO under vacuum in precombusted,
9 mm OD quartz tubes and combusted at 900°C for 3 h. Since the ﬁlter’s TC content was much higher than the
BC content, TC samples were graphitized using a modi ﬁed sealed tube zinc reduction method [ Xu et al .,
2007]. The Δ14C of the TC was measured at the KCCAMS facility as described for BC above.
For samples larger than 0.3 mg C, a separate CO 2aliquot was taken prior to graphitization for δ13C analysis (see
section 2.3.4) with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS; GasBench II, Deltaplus, Thermo Scienti ﬁc( F i n n i g a n ) ,
Waltham, MA, USA). Filters were not acidi ﬁed, because the δ13C of the bulk ﬁlters (/C027.2 ± 0.2 ‰) did not indi-
cate the presence of inorganic carbon.
Since the OC fraction of the aerosol is de ﬁned as the difference between TC and BC [ Gelencser , 2004], we were
able to derive the14C content of OC by isotope mass balance (equation (2)):
Δ14COC¼TC/C2Δ14CTC/C0BC/C2Δ14CBC
TC/C0BC(2)
2.3.4. Elemental and Stable Isotopic Analyses of Bulk PM 2.5
Aerosol samples were also analyzed for their total carbon and nitrogen (N) content and stable isotope ratios
with an elemental analyzer (EA, NA 1500 NC, Thermo Scienti ﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled with IRMS
(DeltaPlus, Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc (Finnigan), Waltham, MA, USA) at the KCCAMS facility. Total carbon and
N concentrations were normalized based on the ﬂow rate of the aerosol samplers and sampling duration
to yield concentrations per cubic meter of air. Stable isotope measurements are reported using conventional
δnotation ( ‰) (equation (3)):

where Rsample denotes the heavy-to-light isotope ratio of the aerosol or soil sample and Rstandard is the
isotope ratio of the standard (0.0112372 for Vienna Pee Dee Belemite13C/12C standard [ Gonﬁantini , 1984] and
0.003676 for air15N/14N standard [ Nier, 1950]. Filter blanks of both TC and N masses, and δ13C and δ15N ratios
of these blanks were used to remove TC and N introduced during the analytical procedure by isotope mass
balance. To get a more representative δ13C result, we combined the gas bench and the elemental analyzer
measurements and calculated weighted averages based on the number of ﬁlter punches used for each
measurement.
2.3.5. Soil Sample AnalysesEach of the four soil cores was separated into three soil horizons upon collection from top to bottom: moss,
ﬁbric, and mesic. Soil samples were dried, weighed, and homogenized with a Wiley mill with a 40 μm sieve.
Bulk density and %C content were measured by Rogers et al . [2014]. Aliquots of the homogenized soils from
each horizon were weighed out and analyzed for their TC and N elemental composition and stable isotopes
δ
13C and δ15N by EA-IRMS. Separate aliquots were weighted out, graphitized via zinc reduction [ Xu et al .,
2007] and analyzed for their14C content by AMS. All of the measurements represent a vertical average for
each homogenized soil horizon.
2.4. Remote Sensing of Fire Activity
To quantify the daily number of active ﬁre/thermal anomalies in interior Alaska during the study period, we
used imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA ’s Aqua and Terra
satellites. Our domain was de ﬁned to encompass a region spanning 58° –71.5°N and 141° –171°W, with the
majority of ﬁres occurring in black spruce forests in the interior. We obtained the global monthly ﬁre location
product (MCD14ML) at 1 km resolution from the University of Maryland Active Fire Products website at ftp://
fuoco.geog.umd.edu. MCD14ML is a list of the combined Terra and Aqua MODIS Level 2 swathMOD14/MYD14 active ﬁres and includes information about the location of the centroid of each thermal
anomaly detection, scan angle, ﬁre radiative power, and a quality ﬂag representing the data con ﬁdence level.
Since the commission error of the MCD14ML product is low in boreal forest ecosystems, we used all of theGlobal Biogeochemical Cycles 10.1002/2015GB005247

active ﬁre/thermal anomaly observations with low, medium, and high con ﬁdence to quantify the temporal
dynamics of ﬁre activity.
2.5. Model Predictions of BC Concentrations
Black carbon emissions from ﬁres were modeled by combining the Alaska Fire Emissions Database (AKFED)
model [ Veraverbeke et al ., 2015] with the coupled Weather Research and Forecasting-Stochastic Time-
Inverted Lagrangian Transport (WRF-STILT) model [ Henderson et al ., 2015]. AKFED is an empirical model of
carbon consumption by ﬁre for Alaska with a spatial resolution of 450 m and a temporal resolution of
1 day [ Veraverbeke et al ., 2015]. WRF-STILT is a tool that can be used to calculate backward trajectories of trace
gas or particulate ﬂuxes [e.g., Nehrkorn et al ., 2010]. Carbon emissions from AKFED were converted with
an emission factor of 0.5 g BC per 1 kg biomass, based on Akagi et al . [2011], and integrated with the
WRF-STILT model to estimate BC concentrations from ﬁres at the Caribou and Delta aerosol sampling
stations. We used the WRF-STILT simulations coupled with AKFED emissions to provide a qualitative estimateof periods of high and low ﬁre emissions. Estimates of BC from these simulations likely had a high bias
because the version of WRF-STILT used here did not include an explicit representation of wet or dry aerosol
deposition and assumed that all ﬁre emissions were injected in the lower half of the boundary layer.
2.6. Comparison With Measurements From the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual
Environments Network
We compared our BC and OC time series with observations from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected
Visual Environments (IMPROVE) aerosol network [ Malm and Sisler , 1994]. We obtained observations from
three IMPROVE stations north of the Alaska Range: Trapper Creek (TRCR; 62.3153°N, /C0150.3156°W, elevation:
155 m above sea level; asl), Denali National Park (DENA; 63.7233°N, /C0148.9675°W, 658 m asl), and Gates of the
Arctic (GAAR; 66.9025°N, /C0151.5170°W, 196 m asl). Each measurement in the IMPROVE time series represents
an average over a 24 h period, and samples are collected every 3 days. BC and OC are measured using the
IMPROVE_A thermal protocol, described by Chow et al . [2007] These data were obtained from the
IMPROVE website (http://vista.cira.colostate.edu/improve/) in February, 2015.
3. Results
3.1. Fire Activity and Carbonaceous Aerosol Concentrations
The 2013 ﬁre season in interior Alaska was characterized by two periods of high ﬁre activity, as described
using the daily sum of ﬁre radiative power measured by MODIS sensors on Terra and Aqua satellites
(Figure 1b). The ﬁrst high ﬁre period occurred during 17 June to 8 July (day of year 168 to 189) and over-
lapped with the beginning of our aerosol measurement campaign. A second period occurred during 1 –14
August (day of year 213 through 226) and overlapped with our ﬁnal set of sampling intervals. A middle period
with little or no daily ﬁre activity from 8 July to 1 August (day of year 190 through 212) was characterized by
several precipitation events and lower vapor pressure de ﬁcits.
At both stations, the concentrations of BC and OC covaried with the timing of ﬁre activity (Figures 2a –2d and
Table 2). The highest detected BC concentrations were 1.12 μg/m3for Caribou during 7 –11 July and
1.31μg/m3for Delta during 28 –30 June, with both maxima overlapping with the ﬁrst high ﬁre period.
Elevated BC concentrations were also detected during the second high ﬁre period, with 0.11 μg/m3measured
at Caribou during 1 –8 August and 0.13 μg/m3at Delta during 7 –10 August. Compared with the relatively low
BC concentrations measured during middle to late July (denoted as background samples in Table 2), the ﬁrst
high ﬁre period was associated with an order of magnitude increase in BC, while the second high ﬁre period
had a 50% to 290% increase.
The OC and TC concentrations followed a similar temporal pattern as BC (Figures 2c and 2d and Table 2), indi-
cating that all of the components of carbonaceous aerosol load were responding to the same set of aerosol
emission and atmospheric transport processes. The highest OC concentrations were 25.5 μg/m3for Caribou
and 17.5 μg/m3at Delta and were measured during the same periods when BC concentrations were highest
(Figures 2c and 2d).

during the 2013 summer. First, modeled BC concentrations from the ﬁre emissions inventory (AKFED)
coupled to the regional atmospheric model (WRF –STILT) predicted elevated BC concentrations from ﬁres
near the beginning and end of our sampling period, similar to the observed pattern (Figures 2e and 2f).
Since only ﬁres from Alaska are included in AKFED, these model simulations con ﬁrmed that boreal forest ﬁres
were the primary driver of the aerosol variability measured at these locations. Second, comparison with datafrom IMPROVE indicated that the BC and OC measurements at Caribou and Delta had similar magnitude and
temporal variability as the aerosols sampled at nearby IMPROVE stations (Figure 3). Two of the northernmost
stations —Denali National Park and Gates of the Arctic —had elevated BC and OC concentrations during late
June and early July and during the ﬁrst two weeks of August, corresponding to the two high ﬁre periods
observed during our sampling campaign. While our measurements of OC from Caribou and Delta were
higher than IMPROVE measurements at Denali and Gates of the Arctic during early July, this difference isFigure 2. Measured aerosol concentrations of (a and b) black carbon (BC) and (c and d) organic carbon (OC) compared to

combined with WRF-STILT and plotted at a 6 h time step. The higher temporal resolution of the model estimates in
Figures 2e and 2f yielded larger concentrations than the observations during short intervals with intense ﬁre inﬂuence.Global Biogeochemical Cycles 10.1002/2015GB005247

consistent with the closer proximity of the Caribou and Delta sampling stations to the perimeter of large wild-
land ﬁres that burned in interior Alaska during the summer of 2013. Potassium (K) measurements from
IMPROVE were elevated at the Gates of the Arctic and Denali National Park stations during these periods,
which is consistent with the aerosols having a ﬁre origin [e.g., Andreae et al ., 1984]. Third, our aerosol Δ14C
analysis, described in the following section, further con ﬁrmed that ﬁres were the dominant contributor to
the aerosol variability, since the times of highest carbonaceous aerosol concentration were also the times
when Δ14C was most positive, indicating a strong biogenic source and a negligible fossil contribution.
3.2. Aerosol Δ14C Variability
TheΔ14C of BC, TC, and the calculated OC positively covaried with concentration and was considerably
more positive during the two high ﬁre periods (Figure 4, Table 2). For BC, the highest measured Δ14CFigure 3. Comparison of (a) BC and (b) OC concentrations measured in this study with time series from the IMPROVE

was 106 ± 11 ‰at Caribou and 94 ± 14 ‰at Delta, while in the year 2013 the Δ14C of atmospheric CO 2at
Point Barrow was 23 ± 3 ‰(X. Xu, unpublished data, 2015). In comparison, minimum values of /C0354 ± 60 ‰
at Caribou and /C057 ± 65 ‰at Delta occurred during intervals with low ﬁre activity (Figures 4a and 4b). For
several sampling periods, BC concentration was too small for14C analysis (Table 2).
TheΔ14C of TC had a similar temporal pattern as BC, with more positive values corresponding to high ﬁre
periods. The highest measured Δ14C of TC was for samples that had the highest aerosol concentration:
115 ± 3 ‰for Caribou and 87 ± 3 ‰for Delta. Overall, TC had more positive values of Δ14C than BC, and
the difference between the Δ14C of TC and BC was largest during low ﬁre periods, indicating that the
14C content of background BC was more depleted than TC. The lowest measured Δ14Co fT Cw a s /C048 ± 3 ‰

Since BC was only a small fraction of TC mass, the calculated Δ14C of OC (see section 2.3.3.) was very close to
that of TC during periods of high ﬁre activity. The highest estimated Δ14C of OC was 116 ± 3 ‰at Caribou and
88 ± 3 ‰at Delta, nearly equivalent to the Δ14C of TC reported for these samples. The Δ14C of OC background
samples was estimated only where Δ14C of BC and TC were simultaneously measured. With this constraint,
theΔ14C of the OC background was higher than TC or BC, with values of 51 ± 7 ‰at Caribou and 45 ± 4 ‰
at Delta (Figures 4e and 4f). These site level differences in the background aerosol Δ14C may re ﬂect a different
proximity of the two stations to regional urban sources, with the Caribou station located about 35 km to the
northeast of the city of Fairbanks and Delta about 153 km to the southeast (Figure 1a).
3.3. Isolating the Δ14C of Fire-Emitted BC, TC, and OC
To quantify the Δ14C signature of ﬁre-emitted aerosol, we used two approaches (Table 3). The ﬁrst approach
was to construct a Keeling Plot using concentration and Δ14C measurements for each aerosol component
(Figure 5). Keeling Plots have been widely used for identi ﬁcation of the isotopic composition of trace gases
[Pataki , 2003] and to assess sources of dissolved organic carbon in marine ecosystems [ Mortazavi and
Chanton , 2004]. The second approach was to remove a mean background concentration and isotope ratio
from the high ﬁre samples. The background was estimated independently for each station from samples
collected during periods of low ﬁre activity. High ﬁre and low ﬁre samples are denoted with footnotes in Table 2.
The Keeling Plot showed that Δ14C and the inverse of concentration of BC at each site were highly correlated,
with R2values greater than 0.94 (Figure 5a and Table 3). The robustness of the type II regression coef ﬁcients
provided con ﬁdence that the technique successfully identi ﬁed the ﬁre end-member. Using this approach, the
Δ14Co f ﬁre-emitted BC was estimated to be 186 ± 34 ‰at Caribou and 89 ± 12 ‰at Delta, where the
reported error is the intercept uncertainty of the Keeling Plot. The Δ14Co f ﬁre-emitted TC was consistent
within the uncertainty between the two stations and was lower than the BC estimate at Caribou (110
±1 6 ‰) and higher at Delta (100 ± 7 ‰) (Figure 5b). The Δ14Co f ﬁre-emitted OC, derived from estimated
concentration and Δ14C, was much closer between the two stations: 102 ± 8 ‰at Caribou and 98 ± 6 ‰at
Delta (Figure 5c).
The second approach for determining the ﬁreΔ14C end-member was to estimate a background aerosol
concentration and Δ14C and then to subtract it from all of the high ﬁre samples at each station. High ﬁre
samples were identi ﬁed as having concentrations of BC greater than 0.11 μg/m3and TC greater than
3.20μg/m3. In parallel, the background was determined separately at each station, consisting at Caribou as
the mean of all samples with BC ≤0.09μg/m3and TC ≤1.28μg/m3and at Delta as the mean of samples with
BC≤0.04μg/m3and TC ≤1.21μg/m3. Note that several sampling intervals had intermediate concentrations
and thus were excluded from this analysis.
Using the background subtraction approach, we estimated that the Δ14Co f ﬁre-derived BC (mean ± 1 stan-
dard deviation ( σ)) was 168 ± 28 ‰(n= 4 high ﬁre samples) at Caribou and 81 ± 25 ‰(n= 2 high ﬁre samples)
at Delta. Similarly, TC estimates were 107 ± 13 ‰and 96 ± 9 ‰at the two stations, and OC estimates were
102 ± 16 ‰and 95 ± 9 ‰.Table 3. Fire-Derived Δ14C(‰) Signature of Black Carbon (BC), Total Carbon (TC), and Organic Carbon (OC)

Averaging across the two sites and the two
approaches used to estimate the ﬁre end-member
(i.e., the Keeling Plot and background removal
approach), the Δ14Co f ﬁre-emitted BC was 131
±5 2 ‰ (mean ± 1 σ, Table 3). Using the same
methodology, the Δ14Co f ﬁre-emitted TC was
103 ± 23 ‰and the Δ14Co f ﬁre-emitted OC was
99 ± 21 ‰. The uncertainty associated with these
regionwide estimates originated from several
sources, including (1) the sampling of different ﬁres
at the two stations, (2) temporal variations in thedepth of burn into soil organic matter layers in
response to variations in ﬁre weather and other
environmental controls, and (3) methodologicaldifferences in the two approaches used for isolat-
ing the ﬁre end-member. With respect to the third
error source, the Keeling Plot and background sub-traction relied on different aspects of the observed
time series. The two approaches, however, yielded
similar estimates at each station (had overlappinguncertainty ranges), providing con ﬁdence in the
ﬁnal estimate.
3.4. The Mean Age of Fire-Emitted Aerosol
TheΔ
14C of the ﬁre end-member provided a partial
constraint on the age of fuels consumed by the
ﬁres during 2013. Assuming the BC originated from
surface soil organic matter layers and aboveground
biomass that could be represented with a single
mean turnover time, and using a time series of
Δ14CO2derived from measurements at Point
Barrow and other Northern Hemisphere stations,
we estimated that the combusted fuels contribut-
ing to Δ14C of BC had mean age of 20 years
(Figure 6). The ±1 σof BC Δ14Co f± 5 2 ‰yielded
an asymmetric age range of 11 to 47 years when
convolved with the atmospheric record. Similarly,we estimated fuel ages of 14 years (with a range
of 11 to 18 years) for TC and 13 years (with a range
of 10 to 17 years) for OC.
3.5. Aerosol Elemental and Stable
Isotope Composition
The C/N ratio of the PM
2.5was elevated during high
ﬁre periods at both stations (Figures 7a and 7b and
Table 4). At Caribou, we measured C/N ratio of 24
± 1 (mean ± 1 σ,n= 4) during high ﬁre periods, and
10 ± 3 ( n= 3) in background air. Similarly, the aver-
age C/N ratio at Delta was 33 ± 8 ( n= 2) during high
ﬁre periods, and 17 ± 9 ( n= 3) for the background.
To estimate and subtract the background contribu-
tion to the C/N ratio, we used the average of our TC and N measurements from the background samples and
subtracted them from the high ﬁre samples at each station (Table 4). This yielded high ﬁre C/N ratios of 29 ± 2
at Caribou and 63 ± 47 at Delta. The high range observed at Delta was driven by one sample (7 –10 August)Figure 5. Keeling plot analysis for (a) BC and (b) TC and
(c) OC for the Caribou (blue) and Delta (red) stations,
respectively. The linear regressions are calculated separatelyfor each station and the results are summarized in Table 3.Global Biogeochemical Cycles 10.1002/2015GB005247

with N concentration almost the same as the background. Averaging across all high ﬁre samples at both sta-
tions, we obtained a mean ﬁre-derived C/N ratio of 40 ± 28 ( n= 6). Excluding the one sampling interval from
Delta with the lowest TC and N almost equivalent to background, the ﬁre C/N ratio decreased to 29 ± 2 ( n= 5).
Theδ15N of aerosol sampled during high ﬁre periods also was considerably higher than levels collected
during background periods (Figures 7c and 7d and Table 4). At Caribou high ﬁre samples had a mean δ15N
value of 12.2 ± 1.1 ‰(n= 4) that was similar to the single value of 12.7 ‰measured at Delta. During the
lowﬁre background period Caribou had a negative δ15No f/C04.3‰(n= 1) and Delta had a mean of 1.9 ‰
(n= 2). Note that the N content of many samples was too low to allow reliable isotopic analysis, particularly
in the later part of the campaign (Table 4).
We estimated the δ15N of the ﬁre end-member using our measurements from low ﬁre background periods
and mass balance calculations (Table 4). The background at each station was computed separately: 0.11
μgN/m3and/C04.3‰at Caribou and 0.07 μgN/m3and 1.9 ‰at Delta. This approach yielded an average ﬁre
δ15N of 17.0 ± 3.7 ‰at Caribou ( n= 4) and 14.0 ‰at Delta ( n= 1). Combining all of the high ﬁre samples from
both stations, we estimated that mean boreal ﬁreδ15N was 16.4 ± 3.5 ‰.
In contrast to δ15N, the δ13C of TC did not vary signi ﬁcantly as a function of time or location (Figures 7e and
7f). The average δ13C among all samples was /C027.2 ± 0.2 ‰(Table 4), which corresponds well to the δ13C
composition of boreal forest biomass [ Brooks et al ., 1997]. The mean δ13C measured in high ﬁre samples from
both sites was the same. We did not attempt to remove a background fraction because of the low variability
in the samples.
3.6. Estimating Depth of Burn From Aerosol and Soil Isotope Measurements
In each soil pro ﬁle, bulk soil carbon density and Δ14C increased as a function of depth from the surface moss
layer to the mesic horizon (Figures 8a and 8b). For the three black spruce pro ﬁles the average Δ14C measured
in the surface moss layer was 78 ‰±1 3 ‰, and this increased to 189 ‰±2 2 ‰for samples collectedFigure 6. The time evolving Δ14C of boreal ﬁre-emitted BC and atmospheric Δ14CO2from 1955 to 2015. The BC aerosol
trajectory was estimated using the observations from 2013 and assuming the ﬁre emissions originated from a carbon
pool with a single, constant turnover time. Atmospheric Δ14CO2data from 1950 from the Heidelberg sampling network
was obtained from Levin et al . [2010] (green) and combined with observations from Point Barrow from 2004 to 2015 (X. Xu,
unpublished data, 2015; purple line). The top right inset focuses on the period since 2004.Global Biogeochemical Cycles 10.1002/2015GB005247

between 15 cm and 28 cm in the mesic layer. Black spruce ecosystems are the dominant contributor to
burned area and carbon emissions in boreal North America [ Rogers et al ., 2015; Veraverbeke et al ., 2015],
and combustion of surface soil organic matter horizons is the primary source of ecosystem-level emissions
[Boby et al ., 2010; Turetsky et al ., 2010; Rogers et al ., 2014]. The mixed white spruce aspen forest soil pro ﬁle
had thinner organic carbon horizons with lower Δ14C values (Figures 8a and 8b), which is consistent with
more rapid rates of soil carbon turnover at this site [ Flanagan and Van Cleve , 1983; Johnstone et al ., 2010].
Both δ13C and δ15N also increased with depth in each soil pro ﬁle (Figures 8c and 8d). The relatively low
δ13C values in the surface layers (with a mean of /C030.5 ± 1.1 ‰) were consistent with re ﬁxation of soil respired
CO2by surface mosses [ Flanagan et al ., 1996]. The δ15N increased from /C03.0 ± 0.7 ‰in the surface moss layerFigure 7. Elemental and stable isotope composition of bulk PM 2.5. The top row shows (a and b) C/N ratio, while the middle

to 1.3 ± 0.8 ‰for the deepest mesic soil samples, which is consistent with greater recycling and preferential
uptake of lighter N by mycorrhizal fungi and plants [ Högberg , 1997].
We created an average Δ14C soil pro ﬁle by assuming that black spruce forests contributed to 70% of regio-
nal emissions [ Veraverbeke et al ., 2015]. We then superimposed the average aerosol Δ14C to estimate a
mean depth of burn consistent with the atmospheric observations, assuming that aboveground compo-
nents of fuel consumption were small (Figure 9a). The Δ14C of BC was consistent with a depth of burn of
20 cm and propagating ±1 σyielded an asymmetrical depth of burn range of 8 cm to 47 cm. Similarly,
Δ14C of TC was consistent with a depth of 16 cm (with a range of 8 to 19 cm), and the average δ13Co f
the TC was consistent with a depth of burning of 25 cm (with a range of 21 to 31 cm) (Figure 9b).
Pooling all three types of aerosol isotope measurement, we estimated average depth of burn of 20 cm (witha range of 8 cm to 47 cm).
Translating this 20 cm mean depth of burn into carbon loss using the data Rogers et al . [2014] yielded a
carbon consumption rate of 2.9 kg C m
/C02(Figure 9c). This value is consistent with reports of average wild ﬁre
carbon consumption from soil organic matter layers in black spruce ecosystems between 2.5 and
3.0 kg C m/C02[Kasischke et al ., 1995; French et al ., 2002; Boby et al ., 2010; Rogers et al ., 2014; Veraverbeke
et al., 2015] and provides a mechanistic underpinning of the causes of isotopic variation in boreal ﬁre aerosol.Figure 9. Depth-integrated measurements of (a) radiocarbon, (b) δ13C, (c) carbon loss per m2from Rogers et al . [2014], and

Solid black lines represent the weighted averages where soil data were available. We used a linear regression in the mesic
layer to extend the estimates deeper in the soil for the purpose of comparing with the aerosol measurements (dashed grey

3.7. Enrichment of Nitrogen Isotopes During Combustion and Atmospheric Processing
Comparison of δ15N in aerosol during high ﬁre periods with soil δ15N pro ﬁles suggests that there is signi ﬁcant
δ15N discrimination as a consequence of combustion and atmospheric chemical processing. The depth-
integrated soil δ15N, weighted for the respective black spruce and mixed white spruce/aspen contributions
to emissions, increases with soil depth (Figure 9d). Taking the δ15No f ﬁre-emitted aerosol ( δ15Naerosol ) and
the burning of soil organic matter as the N source during combustion ( δ15Nsom), we calculated an effective
discrimination [e.g., Högberg , 1997]:
Δcombustion ¼δ15Naerosol/C0δ15Nsom
1þδ15Nsom
1000≅δ15Naerosol/C0δ15Nsom (4)
Using our background-subtracted estimate of ﬁre-emitted δ15N (16.4 ± 3.5 ‰), together with a δ15N of soil
organic matter that corresponded to a depth of 20 cm (0.5 ‰), we estimated that Δcombustion was 15.8 ‰
(±3.5 ‰). Assuming deeper burning to 30 cm had the effect of reducing this estimate to 14.8 ‰(±3.5 ‰)
whereas shallower burning to 10 cm caused an increase to 18.4 ‰(±3.5 ‰). This positive discrimination is
consistent with more of the lighter isotopes of N remaining in the gas phase, and pyrodenitri ﬁcation of
organic N to N 2during combustion [ Kuhlbusch et al ., 1991] preferentially operating on14N.
4. Discussion
4.1. Constraining Boreal Forest Fire Aerosol Contributions Using Radiocarbon
Quantifying the boreal forest ﬁre contribution to the BC load in the Arctic has relied primarily on chemical
transport modeling, based on back trajectory analysis and burned area statistics [e.g., Stohl et al ., 2006;
Hegg et al ., 2009; Warneke et al ., 2009] and/or data validation comparison with chemical tracers such as vanilic
acid [ McConnell et al ., 2007], ammonium [ Keegan et al. , 2014], and levoglucosan [ Yttri et al ., 2014] in aerosol,
snow, or ice samples. The measurements we report here strengthen our capacity to use14C as a tracer for
separating fossil and wild ﬁre contributions to BC deposition in the Arctic. Particularly for aerosols that have
a signi ﬁcant modern fraction, an improved boreal forest ﬁre end-member can help reduce uncertainties in
source apportionment.
In past work, the Δ14C signature of the biomass burning end-member has often been assigned using poorly
quanti ﬁed assumptions about the relative age of the biomass combusted, which varies signi ﬁcantly between
fuels, ecosystems, and regions. The biomass burning end-member is sometimes reported as a range between
recently assimilated biomass (that has the same Δ14C as atmospheric CO 2) and wood for which an age
distribution is prescribed (Table 1). For wildland ﬁres in boreal forests, particularly in North America and
especially in Alaska, this approach is problematic because the primary fuel consumed by ﬁres is soil organic
matter that has accumulated over a period of several decades [ Boby et al ., 2010; Rogers et al ., 2014]. By directly
quantifying the Δ14Co fﬁre-emitted aerosol, we address this problem for boreal ﬁres and report for the ﬁrst
time direct measurements of the Δ14C signature of boreal ﬁre-derived BC, TC, and OC.
The true Δ14C signature for biomass burning evolves through time as a result of the changing atmospheric
Δ14CO2time series and the age of the organic material that is being combusted (e.g., Figure 6). While most
of the studies listed in Table 1 use similar approaches when determining the biomass end-member, only
one reports direct measurements of the biomass burning end-member: Klinedinst and Currie [1999] measured
theΔ14C of TC from the combustion of softwood and hardwood in PM 2.5emissions. After correcting for chan-
ging levels of atmospheric Δ14C, the relative age of softwood reported by Klinedinst and Currie [1999] of 19 to
21 years is in good agreement with our mean BC age estimate of 20 years, yet the origin of the combusted
pool is fundamentally different. Wood burning in many cities in North America may primarily consist of treebranches and boles, whereas for boreal forest ﬁres the predominant carbon source is organic soils. The 11 to
47 year age range we report for BC takes into account different contributions of individual ﬁres and back-
ground variations at our two stations and is larger than the 16 to 28 year range reported by Klinedinst and
Currie [1999].
Boreal- ﬁre-derived BC measured at Caribou was older than the ﬁre-emitted OC at this site when estimated
using either the Keeling Plot or background removal approach (Table 3). Although differences between these
components were not observed at Delta, the age difference at Caribou suggests that under some conditionsGlobal Biogeochemical Cycles 10.1002/2015GB005247

BC and OC aerosol production may be sensitive to different aspects of ﬁre behavior. Flaming ﬁres, in contrast
to smoldering ﬁres, lead to a more complete combustion and more BC production [ Reid et al ., 2005; Yokelson
et al., 2013]. In boreal forests, higher BC/OC ratios reported during ﬂaming ﬁres [Mazurek et al ., 1991; Conny
and Slater , 2002] also may correspond to periods when atmospheric conditions are drier, enabling more
complete combustion of small stems, branches, and deeper organic layers. If these fuels are older than fuels
consumed during smoldering phases, then BC would be expected to have more positive Δ14C values. To test
this hypothesis, and whether BC and OC age differences are robust, higher-resolution measurements are
needed in close proximity to large boreal wild ﬁres, preferably during contrasting periods of ﬁre weather pro-
moting smoldering and ﬂaming ﬁre behavior.
4.2. Fire-Climate Feedbacks and Implication for the Arctic
Reducing uncertainties in BC loading, deposition, and source attribution is particularly important in the Arctic
during summer months, where BC climate feedbacks are most active [e.g., Sharma , 2004; Bond et al ., 2013;
Keegan et al. , 2014]. Here we demonstrate that boreal ﬁres in Alaska are a main source of BC in summer in
a year with average burning. Over the past ﬁve decades, large ﬁre years in Alaska have become more
frequent [ Kasischke et al ., 2010; Kelly et al ., 2013]. Turetsky et al . [2010] showed that in Alaska, ground layer
combustion has accelerated regional carbon losses over the past decade, owing to increases in burn areaand late-season burning. With the wild ﬁre season expected to become longer and more intense [ Amiro
et al., 2009; Balshi et al ., 2009; de Groot et al ., 2013; Flannigan et al ., 2013], the BC contribution to the Arctic
climate feedbacks would also be expected to increase.
One possible outcome is that the likelihood of widespread melt events like the one observed in Greenland by
Keegan et al. [2014] may increase, especially if ﬁre plumes are injected high enough into the free troposphere.
Val Martin et al . [2010] observed a positive correlation between MODIS-detected ﬁre radiative power and
plume heights, indicating that higher plumes are the result of higher ﬁre intensity. Under current prediction
of increased boreal ﬁre intensity [ de Groot et al ., 2013; Flannigan et al ., 2013] one can expect deeper burning
constituting more emissions and higher injection heights, thus increasing the likelihood for aerosol
deposition in remote areas of the Arctic. These interactions highlight the need for future work to betterunderstand how a changing boreal ﬁre regime in ﬂuences BC emissions and deposition.
As
14C becomes more widely used for BC source attribution, our estimates may reduce uncertainties in BC
source apportionment in the Arctic. An important future step will be to use the recent methodological
improvements and the end-member data described here to quantify the contribution of boreal ﬁres in
Alaska to the BC loading and deposition in different areas of the Arctic. Using remote measurements to
constrain models will improve our capacity to quantify and predict future climate forcing from BC.
4.3. In ﬂuence of Depth of Burn on Aerosol Isotopic Composition
Another important implication of this study is the possible use of aerosol Δ14C and soil isotope pro ﬁles to
infer information about the depth of burning into the organic soils. Soil organic matter in Alaskan boreal
forests is known to comprise the vast majority of carbon losses emitted during fuel consumption [ Dyrness
and Norum , 1983; Kasischke et al ., 1995; French et al ., 2002; Veraverbeke et al ., 2015]. Since surface ﬁres and
subsequent smoldering in Alaskan black spruce forests can consume the ground layer biomass down to
the mineral soil, with an average consumption of 40 –60% of the biomass in the soil organic horizons
[Dyrness and Norum , 1983; Kasischke et al ., 1995], the propagation of the14C bomb spike into these horizons
can provide information about the contribution of different layers to the overall fuel consumption. A possible
advantage of an aerosol-based approach is that remote air sampling may enable averaging over wide range
of climate and landscape characteristics that are known to in ﬂuence ﬁeld measurements of fuel consumption
[French , 2004; Kane et al ., 2007; Turetsky et al ., 2011].
We used our isotope measurements of ﬁre-emitted BC in the summer of 2013, together with soil pro ﬁle mea-
surements near the 2010 Gilles Creek ﬁre perimeter to estimate a mean depth of burn of 20 cm and a range
from 8 to 47 cm (Figure 9). In comparison, the AKFED-estimated average depth of burning in black spruce
ecosystems for 2013 was 13 cm with a standard deviation of 4 cm. While our estimate of depth of burn ishigher than the AKFED model prediction, the two estimates agree within known uncertainties. The depth
of burn reported by Rogers et al . [2014] for the Gilles Creek ﬁre ranged between 1 and 30 cm, with a mean
of 19 cm in black spruce ecosystems, which also is consistent with our mean estimate. Our study providesGlobal Biogeochemical Cycles 10.1002/2015GB005247

evidence that the carbon isotopic composition of aerosols emitted by boreal ﬁres is signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuenced
by the depth of burn in organic soils.
Quantitative use of aerosols to reduce uncertainties in boreal fuel consumption may be possible but would
require more extensive atmospheric and soil isotopic sampling. High temporal resolution aerosol samplingduring a high ﬁre year, however, has the potential to immediately test if the depth of burning becomes
progressively deeper through the ﬁre season as a consequence of a thickening active layer and improved
drainage of deeper soil horizons [ Soja, 2004; Turetsky et al ., 2011; Kasischke and Hoy , 2012; Veraverbeke
et al., 2015]. If this mechanism is important at a regional scale, we would expect increasing levels of Δ
14C,
δ13C, and δ15No f ﬁre aerosol as the ﬁre season progresses. If other processes dominate, however, including
seasonal changes in burning among different vegetation types or controls by synoptic-scale variations in ﬁre
weather, we would expect other patterns to emerge in the aerosol isotope tracers.
4.4. Nitrogen Isotope Discrimination During Combustion
Theδ15N in aerosols exhibited signi ﬁcant enrichment during high ﬁre periods that is likely associated with
discrimination during combustion and atmospheric chemistry processes. High δ15N in aerosols has been
observed in other studies [ Kundu et al ., 2010; Aggarwal et al ., 2013; Mkoma et al ., 2014; Pavuluri et al .,
2015], but the pathways responsible for the more positive δ15N measured in aerosols are not fully under-
stood. Turekian et al . [1998] reported δ15N range of particular matter produced by biomass burning of tropical
C3 plants of 2.0 ‰to 19.5 ‰in a laboratory setting. The observed discrimination during the combustion pro-
cess with respect to the δ15N of the plant material ranged from /C01.3 to 13.1 ‰.Turekian et al . [1998] further
suggested that different nitrogenous compounds are accessed at different temperatures of heating, which
could explain some of the variability in our measurements. Other studies suggest that the isotopic enrich-
ment of15N is associated with atmospheric processing of aerosols, in particular, gas to particle conversion
of NH 3and NO x[Pavuluri et al ., 2010; Aggarwal et al ., 2013].
Studies have reported δ15N data for aerosols derived from different combustion sources such as diesel (4.6
±0 . 8 ‰), natural gas (7.7 ± 5.9 ‰), fuel oil ( /C07.5 ± 8.3 ‰), coal ( /C05.3‰), and unleaded gasoline (average
4.6‰, ranging from /C016 to 16 ‰)[Widory , 2007]. Our study presents the ﬁrst measurements indicating the
presence of δ15Nd i s c r i m i n a t i o nf o r ﬁre-emitted aerosols in boreal forest ecosystems and provides evidence
for discrimination levels that exceed observations from the other systems.
5. Conclusions
We measured BC concentration together with isotopic and elemental composition of bulk aerosols in interior
Alaska in the summer of 2013 during periods with high and low boreal forest ﬁre activity. Our measurements
agree with atmospheric transport model predictions and IMPROVE network observations, indicating thatboreal ﬁre emissions were a signi ﬁcant driver of BC and OC aerosol variability in Alaska during a year with
average burning. We also measured the radiocarbon content of BC, thus being the ﬁrst study to directly
constrain the Δ
14C end-member of boreal ﬁre-emitted BC. The ﬁre-emitted Δ14C signature of BC may help
quantify the boreal ﬁre contribution to the BC load in the Arctic under a changing boreal ﬁre regime and
reduce uncertainties in BC source apportionment studies. Our analysis of the elemental and isotopic compo-sition of aerosols shows that the depth of burn in soil organic matter layers signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuences aerosol
composition. Combining Δ
14C and δ13C analysis of aerosols with soil pro ﬁle observations in future work
may provide a constraint on spatial and temporal variations in the depth of burn and fuel consumption in
boreal forest ecosystems.

With climatic warming, wildfire occurrence is increasing in the boreal fo rest of
interior Alaska. Loss of catchment vegetation during fire can impact stre ams directly
through altered solute and debris inputs and changed light and temperatur e regimes.
Over longer time scales, fire can accelerate permafrost degradation, alt ering
catchment hydrology and stream nutrient dynamics. In 2004, the 217,000 ha
Boundary Fire burned 65 %of an established study site in the Caribou-Poker Creeks
Research Watershed. We used this opportunity to investigate the impact of wildfire
on stream chemistry and metabolism in boreal forest catchments. Wildfire impacts
on chemistry were evaluated by examining solute chemistry in four catchme nts from
2002 to 2007. Ecosystem metabolism was measured over the summer of 2005 in o ne
burned and two unburned catchments. Wildfire led to stream nitrate concen tration
increasing up to threefold, whereas dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and di ssolved
organic nitrogen concentrations decreased post-fire. Average stream gr oss primary
production in the burned catchment was double that of the unburned sites (2 .4 and
1.2 g O 2m22day21, respectively). Respiration rate was also elevated in the burned
stream (6.6 g O 2m22day21) compared with the control streams (1.2 and
4.5 g O 2m22day21). Climatic warming has the potential to impact boreal forest
streams through permafrost thaw and increased fire frequency, leading to altered
solute inputs and production and respiration rates.

Introduction
In the boreal forest, wildfire is a widespread disturbance and
fundamental in shaping forest structure, function, and succession-
al processes (Chapin et al., 2006). With climatic warming, the
northern boreal forest is predicted to experience earlier onset of
the wildfire season combined with a potential increase in the
number and size of fires (Kasischke et al., 1995; Stocks et al.,
1998). In regions with permafrost, the effects of fire on surface
organic layer depth, albedo, and vegetation are likely to initiate a
positive feedback on soil temperature, contributing to decreased
permafrost extent and increased depth of seasonal thaw (Burn,
1998; Yoshikawa et al., 2003).
Wildfire has the potential to impact boreal forest streams over
short time scales via change in catchment vegetation and soil
characteristics, and over longer time scales through reduced
permafrost extent, altered vegetation successional trajectories,
and changes in hydrological pathways. Immediate impacts of fire
on stream ecosystems include changes in temperature and light
regimes through loss of shading riparian canopy (Gresswell, 1999;
Hitt, 2003). Streams are closely coupled to their catchments with
allochthonous inputs serving as an important source of organic
matter and nutrients. Combustion of terrestrial organic matter
may alter delivery of solutes to streams, in particular carbon,
nitrogen, phosphorus, and base cations (Bisson et al., 2003;
Gresswell, 1999). In addition, loss of riparian vegetation can alter
inputs of coarse and fine particulate organic matter and woody
debris to streams (Benfield, 1997). A reduced rate of catchment
evapotranspiration following wildfire may also lead to changes instream discharge and hydrologic flowpaths through watersheds,
thereby altering both the magnitude and timing of flows and
solute delivery to streams (Earl and Blinn, 2003; Petrone et al.,
2007; Williams and Melack, 1997).
Vegetation stand type and permafrost extent are intimately
linked and generally maintained through negative feedbacks in
boreal forest watersheds. Soils underlying black spruce stands are
generally wetter and more acidic than soil underlying deciduous
stands (Baldocchi et al., 2000; Ping et al., 2005), which keeps
organic soil mineralization low, and promotes maintenance of a
thick organic layer and underlying permafrost. When fire in black
spruce forest is accompanied by removal of organic soils and
disruption of the soil thermal regime, it can lead to establishment
of deciduous stands, which is most likely to occur in areas where
permafrost is unstable (Chapin et al., 2004). Over successional
time scales, change in vegetation type and the loss of underlying
permafrost have potential to alter soil nutrient chemistry, soil
active layer depth, and catchment hydrologic flowpaths, with
associated change in allochthonous inputs to streams.
Alteration of stream physical and chemical properties by fire
will likely impact stream ecosystem functioning. Whole stream
metabolism is a measure of instream primary production and
ecosystem respiration and, as such, is an integrative measure of
stream function. The rate of metabolism can have significant
ramifications for nutrient uptake in streams, downstream trans-
port of nutrients, and stream food webs (Amon, 2002; Bunn et al.,
1999; Hall and Meyer, 1998; Hall and Tank, 2003; Thorp, 2002).

and discharge are important determinants of production andArctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research, Vol. 41, No. 4, 2009, pp. 407–417

Gausch et al., 1995; Uehlinger, 2000). Post-fire alteration of
discharge regime, canopy loss, and nutrient enrichment have been
shown to alter invertebrate assemblages and stream food webs
(Minshall et al., 1997; Spencer et al., 2003; Vieira et al., 2004).
The objectives of this research were twofold. First, we
examined the impact of wildfire on stream nutrient and dissolved
organic matter (DOM) chemistry over a six-year period. Second,
we examined the impacts of wildfire on stream functioning by
measuring whole stream metabolism in one stream draining a fire
impacted catchment and in two control streams. We hypothesized
that wildfire in the surrounding catchment would lead to increased
inorganic nutrient input to streams, thereby alleviating any
nutrient limitation and resulting in increased rate of GPP. In
contrast, we hypothesized that combustion of soil carbon stocks in
the surrounding catchment and reduced allochthonous DOM
input to streams would result in a lower rate of stream ecosystem
respiration.
STUDY SITES
Our study was conducted in the Caribou-Poker Creeks
Research Watershed (CPCRW; 65.15 uN, 147.5 uW), located
approximately 50 km NE of Fairbanks, Alaska. The CPCRW is
a pristine, 104-km2catchment reserved for hydrological and
ecological research. The climate of CPCRW is continental, with
warm summers (mean 516.4uC in July), cold winters (mean 5
229uC in January), and low precipitation (411 mm, of which 31 %
falls as snow). The research site is located in the zone of
discontinuous permafrost, with the extent of permafrost underly-
ing sub-catchments of the CPCRW ranging from 3 to 53 %. The
distribution of permafrost is largely determined by aspect and
winter temperature, with permafrost found predominately on
north-facing slopes and in valley bottoms (Haugen et al., 1982).
Uplands on south-facing slopes are dominated by hardwood
forests of Alaskan paper birch ( Betula neoalaskana ) and quaking
aspen ( Populus tremuloides ), whereas north-facing slopes generally
have black spruce ( Picea mariana ), and feathermosses ( Pleurozium
schreberi and Hylocomium schreberi ). Several alder species have a
patchy distribution in both uplands ( Alnus viridis ) and valley
bottoms ( A. incana ). Valley bottoms typically have saturated soil
and support growth of mosses (e.g., Sphagnum spp., Hylocomium )
and dwarf shrubs (e.g., Betula nana ,Salix spp., Vaccinium
uliginosum ).
We studied a total of four streams that drained catchments
that varied in size from 5.2 to 10.0 km2and permafrost extents
from 4 to 26 %(C1, C2, C4, and P6 catchments; Table 1, Fig. 1).
Within the CPCRW, the C4 catchment was partially burned in
1999 by a prescribed fire to assess fire and climate feedbacks in theboreal forest (FROSTFIRE project; Hinzman et al., 2003). The
prescribed fire was of moderate intensity, burned 28 %of the
catchment area, and was largely restricted to the black spruce–
dominated north-facing slopes with the riparian zone left mostly
unburned. Stream nitrogen was elevated in C4 during a single
post-fire storm flow, after which stream nutrient concentrations
were not significantly different from pre-fire levels (Petrone et al.,
2007).
The Boundary Fire burned approximately 217,000 ha of
boreal forest in interior Alaska between mid-June and late August
2004. Within the CPCRW, the Boundary Fire burned to the south
of Poker Creek and much of the P6 catchment (Fig. 1). The fire
was of moderate to severe intensity and burned approximately
65%of the P6 catchment. Burning was primarily in upslope, black
spruce–dominated stands. Following the fire, organic soil was
largely intact and there was considerable charred litter and dead
vegetation remaining. The riparian corridor, which had a width of
approximately 40 m, was largely untouched by the fire. Precipi-
tation was unusually low in 2004 and gradually increased from
2005 through 2007 (Fig. 2).
Methods
The impacts of fire on stream chemistry were assessed by
comparing pre- and post-fire stream chemistry in two paired
streams (C1 and P6). P6 was the only catchment in the CPCRW
with comprehensive pre-fire data that was burned during the
wildfire. The C1 stream was selected as the control based on the
similarity in catchment size, permafrost extent, dominant vegeta-
tion, and similarity in response of stream chemistry with changes
in discharge (Table 1). Although the P6 and C4 watersheds had
essentially the same extent of permafrost (18 and 19 %, respec-
tively), the streams have substantially different responses in
streamflow and chemistry during storms. In addition to monitor-
ing stream chemistry, we measured whole-stream metabolism in
three streams (C2, C4, and P6) during summer 2005 to evaluate
nutrient controls over instream respiration and gross primary
production (GPP). All studies were conducted during the ice-free
period when streams are free-flowing (typically June to Septem-
ber).
STREAM CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS
Stream stage height was measured continuously every
15 minutes using pressure transducers at Parshall flumes at the
C2, C4, and P6 streams. Rating curves were developed for all sites
from velocity and stream cross-section measurements. Water
chemistry was measured throughout the summers of 2002–2007 in
the C1, C2, and C4 streams. The P6 stream was sampled fromTABLE 1

408 / A RCTIC ,A NTARCTIC ,AND ALPINE RESEARCHJune to September in all years, except 2004 when water samples
were collected from July to September (post–Boundary Fire).
Stream water samples were collected daily using ISCO auto-
samplers and an additional grab sample was collected every 1 to 2
weeks. Previous analyses at CPCRW have shown that for most
solutes, including nitrate and DOC, the concentration measured in
autosampler-collected samples (without use of preservatives)
stored for two weeks is not significantly different from grab
sample concentrations ( r250.95; slope 50.99; Jones et al., 2005).
Samples were collected in acid washed high density polyethylene
bottles, stored in a cooler for transport to the lab and filtered
within 12 h using glass fiber filters (Gelman A/E). Samples were
stored at 4 uC until analysis (usually within 48 h). When samples
could not be analyzed immediately, samples were filtered using
glass fiber filters (Gelman A/E) and frozen. Several sample dates
were missed at each stream due to mechanical failure of the
autosamplers.
STREAM METABOLISM
In-stream GPP, respiration, and net ecosystem productivity
(NEP) were calculated from the diel change in dissolved oxygenconcentration using the single-station, whole-stream technique
(Bott, 1996; Odum, 1956). Metabolism was measured over 24 h
approximately biweekly in 2005 from June through August in C2
and C4 streams, and approximately biweekly from July through
August in the P6 stream. Metabolism was not measured in the P6
stream in June due to equipment failures. Because interior Alaska
experiences up to 20 h of daylight during the summer, we
calculated daily respiration from the minimum hourly change in
dissolved oxygen over the day. On each date, dissolved oxygen was
measured every 15 minutes using CS511–L Sensorex dissolved
oxygen probes connected to Campbell Scientific CR10X datalog-
gers (Campbell Scientific). Dissolved oxygen probes were cali-
brated on each metabolism measurement date using a spectro-
photometric dissolved oxygen method (Roland et al., 1999).
Triplicate 250-mL water samples were collected in BOD bottles
from the thalweg of each stream, and immediately fixed in the field
with 2.5 mL MnSO 4and 2.5 mL KOH–KI. Stream temperature
probes were calibrated at the time of metabolism measurements
using a high-precision thermometer. To express metabolism on an
areal basis, stream widths were measured once at all sites in 2005.
All of the study streams have incised stream channels, and, as a
consequence, width does not vary appreciably with discharge.
Width was measured at 5 m intervals over a 200 m reach and
averaged.
Oxygen exchange with the atmosphere was determined using
the steady-state injection technique (Hibbs et al., 1998; Mulhol-
land et al., 2001). We conducted eight injections across a range of
flows to develop a model relating evasion rate to streamflow.
Evasion was quantified in the C2 and C4 streams, which have the
lowest and highest streamflows of the streams studied. In the lab
prior to injections, SF 6was injected into collapsible containers of
conservative tracer (dissolved Cl2or Br2) and allowed to
equilibrate for 24 h. The resulting solution was injected into the
study stream 300 m upstream from the dissolved oxygen probe
using a metering pump (flow rate 550 mL min21) until steady-
state of the conservative tracer was achieved at the downstream
station (approximately 3 h). Prior to each injection, triplicate
water and triplicate gas samples (30 mL stream water collected in
60 mL polyethylene syringes) were collected from the thalweg at
sampling stations every 50 m downstream from the injection site
(300 m total reach length).

LABORATORY ANALYSES
Anions (NO 32,S O 422) and cations (NH 4+,C a2+,M g2+,N a+,
K+) were quantified using a Dionex DX -320 Ion Chromatograph.
Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was measured using the
molybdate blue method using a Beckman DU 640B spectropho-
tometer (American Public Health Association, 1998). DOC
concentration was measured using a Shimadzu 5000 total organic
carbon analyzer, which was plumbed to an Antek 7050 nitric oxide
chemoluminescent detector to quantify total dissolved nitrogen
(TDN). Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was calculated as
TDN2(NH 4++NO 32). Dissolved oxygen samples were acidified
with 2.5 mL 12N H 3PO 4and the light absorbance at 430 nm read
using a Beckman DU 640B spectrophotometer according to the
method described by Roland et al. (1999). SF 6was measured by
allowing syringes to warm to room temperature, adding a 30 mL
helium headspace, and equilibrating for 2 h. The headspace was
then injected into a Varian CP 3800 gas chromatograph (1 mL)
and measured with an electron capture detector.DATA ANALYSIS

using one-way ANOVA ( a50.05). The effects of fire on stream
chemistry were tested in two manners. First, we used a two-way
ANOVA to test for significant differences in chemistry among
streams, and prior and post-fire. The interaction term, in
particular, was evaluated to determine if the degree of change in
stream chemistry before and after the fire in the burned watershed
differed from the other streams. Second, we further evaluated
interannual patterns in stream chemistry using a one-way
ANOVA with the differences in stream chemistry between the
stream draining the burned watershed and a control stream. This
second approach was used to maximize our ability to detect
interannual changes following the fire. The control was selected
based on the greatest similarity in the daily change in stream
chemistry between the control and treatment stream, which was
the C1 stream. Significant differences among streams ( p,0.05)
were further evaluated using Tukey’s multiple-comparison test.
Results
STREAM SOLUTE CHEMISTRY
Stream nitrate concentration varied significantly among
CPCRW streams (Table 2). Prior to the fire, the mean nitrate
concentration in the streams in the lower permafrost watersheds
was 0.51 and 0.59 mg N L21(C2 and C4 streams, respectively)
compared with 0.24 and 0.28 mg N L21in the streams draining
the higher permafrost watersheds (C1 and P6, respectively;
Table 2). Stream water DOC concentration, in contrast, exhibited
the opposite pattern with greatest concentration in the streams
draining the higher permafrost watersheds. Prior to the fire, the
mean DOC concentration in streams in the lower permafrost
watersheds was 3.3 and 3.4 mg C L21(C2 and C4 streams,
respectively) compared with 4.7 and 5.7 mg C L21in streams
draining the higher permafrost watersheds (C1 and P6, respec-
tively). While the mean DOC concentration among streams varied
nearly twofold, DON concentration prior to the fire only varied
from 0.28 to 0.32 mg N L21(Table 2). Coupled to the patterns in
DOC, the C:N of dissolved organic matter tended to be greatest in
higher permafrost streams with values of 20.8 in P6, 19.0 in C1,
15.1 in C4 and 13.2 in C2 streams. Similar to the pattern in nitrate,
sulfate and base cation concentrations tended to be greatest in the
streams draining the lower permafrost watersheds for streams in
the Caribou Creek sub-watershed (Table 2). In the P6 stream,
sulfate and most base cation concentrations were always equal to
or greater than in the tributaries of Caribou Creek, suggesting a
difference in parent geology (Table 2). SRP concentration was
almost always below detection limits ( ,1mgL21).
WILDFIRE IMPACTS ON STREAM CHEMISTRY
Following the wildfire, nitrate, sulfate, and potassium
concentrations increased in the impacted stream, whereas DOC
and calcium concentrations declined relative to the three
undisturbed streams (Tables 2 and 3). Wildfire had a dramatic
effect on stream nitrate concentration (Fig. 3, Tables 2 and 3).
During 2002–2003, nitrate concentration was on average only
0.08 mg N L21lower in the P6 (burned) stream compared with
the C1 (control) stream. Nitrate concentration post-fire in 2004
did not significantly change in the P6 stream compared with the
control, although 2004 was a dry summer with little rainfall
(Fig. 2) and low streamflow. In subsequent summers following the
410 / A RCTIC ,A NTARCTIC ,AND ALPINE RESEARCHfire (2005–2007), nitrate concentration in the P6 stream increased
substantially compared with the pre-fire difference between
burned and control streams (mean difference 0.30 mg N L21;
Table 3, Fig. 3). Post-fire, nitrate concentration in the P6 stream
was on average over twofold greater with 0.65 mg N L21
compared with 0.28 mg N L21in years 2002–2004 (Table 3,
Fig. 3).
DOC and DON exhibited the opposite pattern to nitrate with
the concentration declining post-fire. Prior to the fire the DON
concentration in the P6 stream was on average 0.05 mg N L21
greater than in the control stream (2002 and 2003; Table 3, Fig. 4).
Post-fire, DON concentration in the burned stream declined
compared with the control to the point that DON concentration in
the control stream exceeded the burned stream in 2005 (Table 3,
Fig. 4). Similar to the pattern in DON, DOC concentration
declined in the burned stream post-fire, although the response was
delayed until the wetter years of 2006 and 2007. From 2002 to
2005, the DOC concentration in P6 stream was on average
1.2 mg C L21greater than in the control stream (Table 3, Fig. 5).
In 2006 and 2007, however, the DOC concentration in the P6stream significantly declined relative to the control stream to the
point at which the burned stream had on average 0.5 mg C L21
less than the unburned stream (Table 3). Coupled to the change in
DOC and DON concentrations, the C:N of DOM significantly
declined in the burned stream compared with the reference. Prior
to the fire, the C:N of the DOM in the P6 stream averaged 22.9
(2002 and 2003), but tended to decline post-fire (2004, 2006, 2007).
ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM
Gas evasion rate was quantified across streamflows ranging
from 19 to 60 L s21and velocities from 0.13 to 0.24 m s21. Using
our field-based measurements of gas evasion and streamflow with
a generalized form of the Bennett and Rathburn (1972) model, the
equation that best described oxygen evasion was (R250.72)

Across injections, the gain in streamflow across a 200 m injection

substantially higher production than either C2 or C4 (Figure 6).

Discussion
CPCRW STREAM CHEMISTRY
In this study, stream solute concentrations varied widely
among sub-catchments and tended to vary in response to extent of
permafrost (MacLean et al., 1999), although other factors such as
permafrost distribution, catchment size, mineral geology, and
vegetation composition also undoubtedly affect solute chemistry.
Permafrost serves as a barrier to the infiltration of precipitation
into deep soil horizons and is therefore an important regulator of
stream solute concentrations in the region of discontinuous
permafrost (Carey, 2003; Jones et al., 2005; MacLean et al.,
1999; Petrone et al., 2006). In catchments underlain by extensivepermafrost, hydrological flowpaths are restricted to the upper
organic soil horizon, with streams receiving greater DOM inputs.
In contrast, in low permafrost catchments precipitation can
infiltrate through organic horizons to the deeper mineral soils,
producing streams characterized by reduced DOM inputs and
greater nutrient concentrations (Jones et al., 2005; MacLean et al.,
1999; Petrone et al., 2006). High DOC concentration in surface
soil has been attributed to DOC leaching from leaf litter and high
biological activity, whereas reduction of DOC as flow passes
through mineral soil is thought due to abiotic sorption of DOC to
soil particles (McDowell and Likens, 1988). In CPCRW, sulfate,
sodium, and calcium concentrations are considerably higher in
groundwater than in shallow soil, suggesting recently thawed
permafrost soil, mineral soil, and weathering as the primary
sources of these solutes to streamflow (Petrone et al., 2006).
WILDFIRE AND SOLUTE DYNAMICS
Comparison of pre- and post-fire control (C1) and burned
(P6) stream chemistry revealed that wildfire resulted in significant
change in stream solute concentrations in the burned catchment. A
significant decline in stream DOC concentration in P6 was
observed two years following the wildfire. While soil organic
matter was likely altered immediately post fire, the effect on
stream chemistry was not realized until the wetter year of 2006
(2004 and 2005 had particularly low summer precipitation; Fig. 2).
Stream DOC concentration is linked to rainfall and flushing of
organic matter from soil organic horizons in CPCRW streams
(Petrone et al., 2006). The flush of DOC in the C1 catchment in
2007 highlights this relationship, when DOC that had likely
accumulated in soil during the dry period was delivered to the
stream. The lack of a corresponding flush of DOC in P6 reinforces
the interpretation that soil carbon stocks had declined in this
catchment post-fire. The delayed decline in stream DOC
concentration we observed may be a natural response to fire,

and in the year following the fire.
The reduction in DOC concentration observed in 2006 and
2007 may be caused by several processes, including combustion of
soil carbon stocks, transformation of soil carbon to more
recalcitrant and less soluble carbon compounds, or decreased
microbial mineralization of organic carbon due to a post-fire
reduction in microbial biomass (Certini, 2005). A reduction in
allochthonous inputs of coarse and fine particulate organic matter
were likely not contributing to the observed reduction in DOC as
riparian vegetation remained intact along the length of the P6
stream. Following the prescribed burning of the C4 catchment in
1999 (FROSTFIRE; Hinzman et al., 2003), both soil water DOC
and water extractable organic carbon from the organic horizon of
burned slopes declined (Shibata et al., 2003). Ping et al. (2005)
proposed that in boreal forest soils, fire leads to oxidative
combustion of immobile and labile soil organic matter, which is
lost to the atmosphere through and conversion to CO species. The
results from research following the FROSTFIRE, coupled with
the importance of the organic horizon in DOC delivery to streams
in the CPCRW, suggests the observed reduction in stream DOC
concentration in the P6 catchment was due to combustion and
conversion of soil organic carbon stocks in surface soils.
Elevated stream nitrogen concentration, as observed in this
study, is a common response to fire (Bayley and Schindler, 1991;
Hauer and Spencer, 1998; Minshall et al., 1997; Williams and
Melack, 1997). Increased soil ammonium concentration, com-
monly observed following fire, is potentially due to increased
microbial or thermal decomposition of vegetation and soil organic
matter (Chorover et al., 1994; Wan et al, 2001). Any increase in
available ammonium has the potential to be rapidly nitrified and,
in turn, increase soil nitrate availability (Certini, 2005; Wan et al.,
2001). Despite evidence that soil nitrification is not stimulated in
black spruce stands of CPCRW following fire (Lyle, 2006; Smith
et al., 2000), stream nitrate concentration increased in this study,
suggesting there may have been decreased microbial competition
with vegetation for ammonium and increased nitrification.
Alternatively, the pattern of increased nitrate concentration may
be due to increased soil active depth, with two possible
mechanisms leading to nitrate concentration increases. First,
increased thaw depth initiated by wildfire (latent heat transfer
and lower surface albedo) may have improved soil drainage and
increased aeration, thus reducing nitrate removal via denitrifica-
tion. Second, increased active layer depth and improved drainage
may have increased percolation of precipitation to deep mineral
soils, similar to the high nitrate levels in streams draining low
permafrost watersheds.
Comparing the results of our study with a previous study
conducted in CPCRW on fire impacts on stream chemistry
(Hinzman et al., 2003), stream nitrate in the former study
increased for a short period during a single post-fire storm, but
was not elevated at any other time (Petrone et al., 2007). The
difference in the response of stream chemistry between the fires is
likely due to extent of catchment burned and the fire intensity. The
2004 wildfire in P6 burned 65 %of the catchment, compared with
28%of C4 burned during FROSTFIRE. In addition, although the
riparian zone was not burned in the P6 catchment, the fire burned
closer to the stream channel than during the FROSTFIRE burn.
The type of vegetation and soil burned may also play an important
role in nutrient export to streams. In a study of soil chemistry
following wildfire in interior Alaska, soil solution nitrogen was
slightly elevated in black spruce forests, in contrast to soil in
aspen, birch, and white spruce stands where soil nitrogen
concentrations declined following fire (Dyrness et al., 1989). The1999 and 2004 fires both burned black spruce predominately,
indicating that the difference in catchment area burned and
proximity to the stream are the likely causes of the sustained
elevation of stream nitrate at P6.
Stream phosphorus concentration has been shown to either
dramatically increase (Earl and Blinn, 2003; Prepas et al., 2003),
albeit for a brief period, or be unchanged by fire (Minshall et al.,
1997; Stephens et al., 2004). Prior to the 2004 wildfire, SRP
concentration in the C1 and P6 streams was below detection limit
(,1mgPL21), and we observed no detectable post-fire increase
in stream SRP concentration in P6. Other studies in the boreal
forest, however, have reported a change in stream phosphorus
concentration after fire. In a study in the boreal forest of Canada,
total dissolved phosphorus was unchanged after fire, but
particulate phosphorus increased significantly during periods of
high discharge (Prepas et al., 2003). In northwest Montana, stream
phosphorus concentration was over fivefold higher in burned than
control streams, and this difference was sustained for a period of
several years (Hauer and Spencer, 1998). The observed increase in
nitrate, sulfate, and cations in P6 may have been accompanied by
increased total phosphorus concentration, but given our monitor-
ing program we were unable to detect a change.
METABOLISM, WILDFIRE, AND PERMAFROST
Stream respiration and productivity have been shown to be
influenced by various environmental factors, including light
(Acun ˜a et al., 2004, Mulholland et al., 2001; Young and Huryn,
1996), temperature (Lamberti and Steinman, 1997; Sinsabaugh,
1997), nutrient concentrations, organic matter supply (Acun ˜a et
al., 2004, Kreutzweiser and Capell, 2003), discharge (Lamberti and
Steinman, 1997; Uehlinger, 2000; Young and Huryn, 1996), and
catchment disturbance (Houser et al., 2005). In this study, both
GPP and respiration were higher in the stream draining the burned
than unburned catchments, suggesting that fire did indeed have
some indirect impact on ecosystem metabolism.
GPP and respiration were not correlated with temperature,
although average daily stream temperature varied little over
CPCRW sub-catchments in the summer of 2005. Average daily
temperature ranged from 4.8 to 7.9 uC across metabolism
measurement dates in all streams, and is unlikely the cause of
differences in metabolism at these times. Given the high nitrate
concentration in streams of CPCRW, GPP is not likely nitrogen
limited. Moreover, nitrate concentrations were higher in the C2
and C4 streams than the P6 stream, but GPP rates were lower. The
relationship between canopy cover and production was inconclu-
sive, with the highest production occurring in the stream with a
mixed riparian cover. Additionally, although algal standing stocks
were not measured, we did not observe any obvious difference in
substrate biomass among streams. Rather, production may be
controlled by phosphorus availability. Given the very low
concentration of SRP in CPCRW streams, limitation of produc-
tion by this nutrient is highly likely, as was found in another study
in interior Alaska (Slavik et al., 2004). Considering the low
ambient concentration of SRP in CPCRW streams, even a minor
SRP increase may have been sufficient to stimulate GPP in
streams draining burned catchments.
Stream respiration rates in CPCRW were greatest in the
stream impacted by fire, perhaps due to increased input of labile
DOC (Findlay et al., 2003, Kreutzweizer and Capell, 2003) or
extent of the hyporheic and transient storage zones (Fellows et al.,
2001; Mulholland et al., 2001). Carbon bioavailability has been
found to be both positively (Striegl et al., 2005) and negatively
414 / A RCTIC ,A NTARCTIC ,AND ALPINE RESEARCH(Kawahigashi et al., 2004) correlated with permafrost extent. In
CPCRW streams, significant differences in stream DOC concen-
tration with catchment stand type suggest differences in carbon
lability among streams. Moreover, White et al. (2008) found that
biologically labile DOC increased with discharge in CPCRW
streams, when flow bypasses mineral soils. We observed a
significant decrease in C:N ratio of DOM following wildfire in
P6, which may be contributing to the higher respiration rate
observed in this stream. Similarly, the variability in catchment
permafrost extent and soil saturation among CPCRW sub-
catchments may result in differences in size of the hyporheic zone
and transient storage among streams.
WARMING, WILDFIRE, PERMAFROST, AND
ECOSYSTEM METABOLISM
Our ability to draw conclusions from this study regarding
drivers on ecosystem metabolism in boreal forest streams is limited
by the lack of treatment replication. Due to the unexpected nature
of the 2004 Boundary Fire and confounding effect of permafrost
coverage on stream chemistry, we were constrained by availability
of pre-existing study sites. Despite this, we have established that
wildfire leads to sustained change in stream solute chemistry. The
role of stream nutrient concentrations and environmental param-
eters in driving ecosystem metabolism remains unclear and
warrants further investigation, particularly during this period of
rapid change in the region of discontinuous permafrost.
Understanding wildfire impacts on stream metabolism and
nutrient chemistry in boreal forest streams needs to be viewed in
light of discontinuous permafrost extent and vegetation feedbacks
and their effect on catchment hydrology. Wildfire impacts on
stream chemistry may be exacerbated by climatic warming and
permafrost degradation. Over the last century, climatic warming
has resulted in a 2.1 %reduction in permafrost extent at CPCRW,
and over one-third of the catchment now has either unstable or
actively thawing permafrost (Hinzman et al., 2006). In the boreal
forest, wildfire most often burns through the highly flammable
black spruce stands (Kasischke et al., 2006). Permafrost typically
underlies black spruce stands, and with fire dramatically altering
the thermal balance of soils, permafrost is likely to become
unstable and/or begin to degrade (Hinzman et al., 2006; Ping et al.,
2005). After fire, black spruce may reestablish, leading to
stabilization of permafrost, or, alternatively, black spruce forests
may be replaced with deciduous stands (Chapin et al., 2004) under
which further degradation of the underlying permafrost is likely.
Fire effects on permafrost extent could be substantial under a
changing climate, and where permafrost is already near the point
of thawing, wildfire may accelerate the rate of degradation.
From this and previous research, it is clear that climatic
change and increased wildfire occurrence may impact stream
chemistry and function in the region of discontinuous permafrost
via two pathways. Short- to medium-term changes to stream
solute concentrations after fire may alter nutrient limitation and
increase rates of whole-stream metabolism. Over longer time
scales, reduction in the extent of underlying permafrost within
watersheds from wildfire and/or warming will lead to change in
watershed hydrologic flowpaths and nutrient inputs into streams,
and again may alter ecosystem functioning.

Abstract: Wildﬁre is a threat for many boreal ecosystems and induces deep modiﬁcations in organic
horizons. In this paper, we have considered ﬁre-induced changes to the organic horizon properties.
The effect of ﬁre was studied by using a forest litter burning experiment. Sample heating was
performed in the lab at ﬁxed temperatures (200, 300 and 500◦C), on a set of O horizons developed
under pine ( Flavocetraria-Pinetum association) and spruce ( Piceetum hylocomium splendens association)
forest litters. Litters were analyzed in terms of pH, speciﬁc electrical conductivity, speciﬁc surface
area, total carbon (C tot) and nitrogen (N tot) content, water-soluble carbon and nitrogen, δ13C and
δ15N stable isotope analysis and13C NMR spectroscopy. The mean pH values increased from ~5 to
~8.2 with an increase in the inﬂuence of temperature. The speciﬁc electrical conductivity and speciﬁc
surface area properties increased as well from ~255 to ~432 and from 0.42 to 1.84, respectively. C tot
and N totdecreased, but at the same time the inorganic carbon content increased. The aromaticity of
organic matter after the ﬁre increased. The results of the present study show that organic horizons
are changed by wildﬁre and this discussion made it clear to help with the understanding how ﬁre
affects organic matter.

1. Introduction
Wildﬁre is one of the most important factors of natural cycles, with its frequency and
severity depending on human activities [ 1]. Fires are a global phenomenon destabilizing all
the components of the biosphere and regulating their functioning, leading to the formation
of new post-ﬁre ecosystems [ 2–6]. Global warming is expected to increase ﬁre frequency and
extent in ecosystems at high latitudes [ 7–9]. Fires in the European part of Russia are spread
more to the North, affecting large areas that used to be less frequently exposed to wildﬁre
events because of climate change in recent years. Over the last decade 2963 wildﬁres with
the total area of 127.51 thousand ha were revealed in the Komi Republic (Northwestern
district, Russia) [ 10]. Most of the wildﬁres were human-caused or resulting from lightning
strikes. The impact of wildﬁres on the natural environment is multidimensional and
complex. By interfering with the carbon, nitrogen, water and other cycles, wildﬁres
frequently upset the ecosystems balance created by decades.
Soil and soil organic horizon are substantial part of ecosystems. Organic horizons are
primarily combustible during wildﬁres and some part of burnt materials is released into the
Sustainability 2022 ,14, 16772. https://doi.org/10.3390/su142416772 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainabilitySustainability 2022 ,14, 16772 2 of 20
atmosphere. The unreleased part and plant remains persist on the soil surface and they are
subsequently transported down into the horizons by the water movement and layering of
new plant material. However, the issue of how organic horizons affect soil organic matter
(SOM) in the high latitude boreal forests has been insufﬁciently studied so far. Given that
boreal forests are the largest in the world, this study may result in important information
that can be applicable globally. Therefore, it is essential to understand the ways of organic
horizon transformation through low intensity surface wildﬁres. In this paper, we consider
only surface ﬁres, as the most frequent and affecting mainly only the organic horizon. It is
known that the components of soils and soil organic horizons undergo deep alterations
during the ﬁre [ 11–13]. This is partially caused by a deep transformation of soil physical,
chemical and biological characteristics associated with qualitative and quantitative changes
in the most functional fraction of soil such as organic matter [ 14–16]. Severity and intensity
of alterations resulting from wildﬁres depend on the type of ﬁres (crown or surface forest
ﬁres), availability, amount, nature, and moisture content of live or dead fuel (ground
vegetation and deadwoods), weather (air temperature, humidity and wind speed) and the
physiography of the site [ 17,18]. All of these factors are increasingly altered by human
activities and can greatly impact the consequences of a ﬁre [ 19,20]. Moreover, mechanical,
physical, chemical and biological properties of soils and litter can be altered immediately
by high temperatures or after vegetation successions [15,21,22].
Major thermal destruction of the entire vegetation cover and soil occurs during intense
crown wildﬁres. The organic component of soil is the one most exposed to ﬁre, in terms
of both content and composition [ 14,23]. Most often ﬁre causes a substantial reduction or
even complete removal of the litter layer [16,23,24].
In turn, minor changes in the composition of organic horizons and soils occur during
rapid surface wildﬁres. At the same time, apart from burning and emissions of gases and
aerosols [ 25], the organic matter (OM) of organic horizons and soils may be transformed [ 15]
and can persist in the ecosystems [ 26,27]. In most forest ecosystems the burnt material
remaining on the soil after wildﬁres mainly comprises non-woody char derived from the
organic horizons. Despite the importance of the role of this material in the carbon balance,
soil conservation and ecological processes, few studies have examined the properties of
this type of charred biomass, which may vary widely in different forest ecosystems and
also within burnt areas [28,29].
Fires in boreal forests and mires frequently occur in the form of smoldering ﬁres in
the soils organic horizons that accumulate in these ecosystems. In contrast to ﬂaming
combustion, smoldering is a ﬂameless form of combustion that occurs when oxygen
reacts with the surface of solid fuels [ 30,31]. This form of combustion typically takes
place at much lower temperatures than ﬂaming combustion (500 to 700◦C versus 1500 to
1800◦C) [32]. In soil organic horizons combustion is known as pyrolysis with partial
oxidation of the fuel resulting in dehydration and charring and char oxidation occurs
reducing the pyrolyzed fuel to ash [33].
Some of the most important parameters that are affected by the ﬁres are fractional
composition, pH, electrical conductivity and speciﬁc surface area, which perform a number
of important functions in soils [ 34–36]. Quantitative and qualitative composition of organic
matter plays an important role in the substances’ cycle and strongly depends on ﬁres and
the content of carbon and nitrogen in different forms as well [ 37–39]. Generally, studies of
the above-mentioned parameters are focused on mineral horizons of soils, with organic
horizons left unattended. The reason why studies do not focus on organic soils is that they
are often burnt to the ground by wildﬁre. Here, we attempt to explore how selected forests
litter parameters change with temperature in order to determine the impact of ﬁres and
eliminate some understanding gaps.
We hypothesized that (1) the main chemical properties of organic horizons will be
strongly transformed as a result of the inﬂuence of high temperatures, (2) the stable13C
and15N isotopes will become heavier, and (3) the degree of aromaticity of organic matter
will increase. Thus, the aims of this study are: (i) to examine the inﬂuence of the heating toSustainability 2022 ,14, 16772 3 of 20
the boreal forest soil organic horizons through conducting a lab-simulation experiment,
and (ii) to unravel the role of ﬁre for the organic horizons.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Area and Combustion Experiment Description
Fires in boreal forests affect large areas and lead to substantial changes of soil and
organic horizon properties [ 22]. The main ﬁre induced changes in soil organic horizons can
be identiﬁed by studying typical boreal forests. The studied pine and spruce conifer forests
are typical for boreal landscapes with a typical composition of organic components [ 40,41].
The experiment was conducted for samples from the northeast of the European part
of Russia (61◦40′N, 50◦48′E). Samples of the organic horizons were collected in the
middle boreal (middle taiga) vegetation zone. The climate is temperate with relatively
cold summers and cold, snow-rich winters (Köppen “Dfc”) [ 42]. Modern average annual
temperatures are from 0 to −2◦C, and the mean precipitation is 600–800 mm per year [ 43].
The altitude ranges from 100 to 150 m above sea level with the lowest elevation in the
gently undulating eastern part of the study area.
The vegetation of the study area is represented by lichen pine forest (PF)
(Flavocetrario-Pinetum association) and green feathermoss spruce forest (SF)
(Piceetum hylocomium association). The studied lichen pine and green moss spruce forests
are located on underlying soils typical of boreal forests, on Podzols and Retisols, respec-
tively. The ground vegetation layers are characterized by the predominance of green
mosses and lichens: Pleurozium schreberi (Willd. ex Brid.), Hylocomium spledens (Hedw.),
Cladonia stellaris (Opiz), Cladonia arbuscula (Wallr.) etc. The herbaceous shrub layer is
distinguished by the constant presence of Vaccinium uliginosum L.,V . myrtillus L., etc.
Two extensive forests (a pine and a spruce one) were selected for sampling. These
forests were selected as typical features of the boreal landscape having undisturbed organic
horizons. The organic horizon samples were collected in a multiple site sampling approach
at the end of the vegetation season. At each forest site organic horizon samples with an
area of 20×20 cm were taken in 15 replications. The distance between samples varied
from 2.5 m to 20 m by randomization. The randomization was based on an indiscriminate
selection of organic horizon samples in the study area. In this paper, organic horizons (O)
are soil layers with a high percentage of organic matter. Typically, in boreal forest area there
are three distinct organic layers: one of leaves, pine needles and twigs (O i); underlain by a
partially decomposed layer (O e); and then a very dark layer of well decomposed humus
(Oa). The samples had been brought into the air-dry condition before they were split into
subhorizons O i, Oe, and O a(Figure 1). The subhorizon O ifor each of the forest litters was
disassembled into fractions to reveal the mass fraction of individual components. Soil
samples were separated and homogenized, sieved (2 mm) and stored at room temperature
till the laboratory analysis.
Under pine forest, the O i(fresh litter subhorizon) layer with thicknesses between
1 and 4 cm was composed of recent, poorly transformed vegetation remains. Underneath
the O i, Oe+asubhorizons (1–4 cm thickness) were observed, mainly formed by fragmented
plant residues that were, generally, of coniferous-lichen origin including well decomposed
vegetation remains. In the pine forest, O eand O aare combined into one due to the impos-
sibility of accurately separating the subhorizons. The organic horizons of spruce forest
displayed different structures with thinner Oi subhorizon (1–2 cm thickness), followed by
potent and thicker O eand O asubhorizons (1–3 cm). Lower subhorizon O aconsisting of
well–decomposed organic matter (1–3 cm).
Organic horizon samples were placed in porcelain crucibles and covered with alu-
minum foil. Each of the porcelain crucibles was oven-heated for 3 h in ashing furnace
LV9/11 P330 (Nabertherm, Lilienthal, Germany) equipped with a thermometer at a speciﬁc
temperature (t): 200, 300 and 500◦C. A heating time of 3 h was selected in accordance
with recent studies [ 34,44]. The greatest transformation is generally experienced under
conditions of steady surface ﬁres with great masses of large wood debris, which are charac-Sustainability 2022 ,14, 16772 4 of 20
terized by a long time of burning. It is known that the temperature under these conditions
may reach 500–700◦C [45]. Therefore, we selected 200, 300 and 500◦C temperature values
in order to simulate low intense ﬁre to be able to observe changes in the forest litter.

2.2. Organic Horizons Analysis 
2.2.1. General Analysis 
The study samples of forest litters were divided into subhorizons. Litters from pine 
(PF) and spruce (SF) forests were divided into O
i, O e+a and O i, O e and O a layers, respec-
tively. The subhorizons were separated accord ing to the degree of decomposition of or-
ganic matter. At each site litter layers Oi were divided into plant fractions. As a result, we 
have received the fractional content of plant remains by weight. The weight loss was cal-
culated in the dry condition of organic horizons for various thermal conditions: 200, 300 and 500 °C. 
Chemical analyses of the litters were performed in the certified Ecoanalytic labora-
tory of the Institute of Biology (Komi Scienc e Center, Urals Branch of the Russian Acad-
emy of Sciences) (certificate ROSS RU.0001. 511257 from September 2019) and Soil science

2.2. Organic Horizons Analysis
2.2.1. General Analysis
The study samples of forest litters were divided into subhorizons. Litters from pine (PF)
and spruce (SF) forests were divided into O i, Oe+aand O i, Oeand O alayers, respectively.
The subhorizons were separated according to the degree of decomposition of organic matter.
At each site litter layers Oi were divided into plant fractions. As a result, we have received
the fractional content of plant remains by weight. The weight loss was calculated in the dry
condition of organic horizons for various thermal conditions: 200, 300 and 500◦C.
Chemical analyses of the litters were performed in the certiﬁed Ecoanalytic laboratory
of the Institute of Biology (Komi Science Center, Urals Branch of the Russian Academy of
Sciences) (certiﬁcate ROSS RU.0001.511257 from September 2019) and Soil science depart-
ment. The pH values were determined on an HI2002-02 edge series pH meter with a Hanna
digital pH electrode (Hanna Instruments, Romania) at a soil:water ratio of 1 (m):25 (v) for
initial and pyrogenic horizons, respectively. Speciﬁc electrical conductivity (SEC) aqueous
extract was measured in a water-solution, which is prepared from 1 g of soil sieved through
a 2-mm mesh mixed with 25 mL of distilled water with a litter:water (1:25) ratio and held
for 24 h. Measurement of speciﬁc electrical conductivity (SEC) was performed with an
FG3 conductometer (Mettler-Toledo, Switzerland). Filtration of litters was done immedi-
ately after shaking with hydrophilic regenerated cellulose (pore size of 0.45 µm, Sartorius,
Germany). Water-soluble (WS) carbon (CWS), inorganic carbon (IC) and nitrogen (NWS)
were assessed using the TOC-VCPN analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan) with TNM-1 module. CWS
and IC were measured using the method of thermal catalytic oxidation with non-dispersive
IR registration.
2.2.2. Speciﬁc Surface Area by N 2Gas Adsorption
Speciﬁc surface area (SSA) of the samples was tested by conduction using a surface-
area analyzer (Sorbtometr-M, Katakon, Novosibirsk, Russia) with N 2gas as an adsorbate
at the Faculty of Soil Science, Lomonosov Moscow State University (Moscow, Russia). AllSustainability 2022 ,14, 16772 5 of 20
samples were kept in a vacuum chamber at 105◦C for at least 24 h before analysis to
remove hygroscopic moisture. Directly before analyses the samples were heated (30 min)
in a helium stream at a temperature of 100◦C to remove absorbed gases and vapors from
its surface. The SSA analysis operation is based on the thermal removal of nitrogen from
the surface of the samples under dynamic conditions. Sorption was carried out at a boiling
point of liquid nitrogen of 77 K and a relative pressure P/Po = 0.20 (single-point method).
Surface area was calculated by BET adsorption theory [46].
2.2.3. Isotopic Analyses
The stable isotope ratios13C/12C and15N/14N were determined by an IsoPrime
100 isotope ratio mass-spectrometer (IsoPrime Corporation, Cheadle, UK) and vario ISO-
TOPE cube elemental analyzer (Elementar Analysen systeme GmbH, Hanau, Germany).
Stable isotope compositions are reported in delta notation ( δ13C and δ15N‰) relative to
Vienna Pee-Dee Belemnite (VPDB) for C, using the international reference materials IAEA-
CH-6 (−10.449±0.033‰ VPDB), IAEA-CH-3 ( −24.72±0.04‰ VPDB) as standards, and
relative to atmospheric N2 for N, using IAEA-N-2 (+20.3 ±0.2‰air N 2) and USGS-25
(−30.41±0.27‰ air N2) as standards according to Equation (1):

where R represents the ratio of13C/12C or15N/14N, respectively. The measurement error
ofδ15N was approximately 0.2‰ and 0.1‰ for δ13C.
2.2.4.13C NMR Spectroscopy
Solid-state13C cross polarization with magic angle spinning (CP/MAS) nuclear mag-
netic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to analyze the composition of the organic
matter. In the present work, this is used to characterize the pyrolyzed materials, analyse
their content in aliphatic and aromatic compounds. Before13C NMR analysis, combined
samples were treated with 10% hydroﬂuoric acid, as described by Goncalves et al. [47], to
remove paramagnetic iron, which strongly reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.
Solid-state13C NMR spectra of the organic horizons were recorded on a 100.53 MHz
Bruker Avance III 400WB (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) with a rotation frequency of
12.5 kHz, a contact time of 5 ms, and a 2-s recycle delay at the resource center of the
research park “Magnetic Resonance Research Methods” of Saint-Petersburg State Uni-
versity, Russia. Chemical shifts of fractions were determined in relation to a tetramethylsi-
lane (TMS) shift (0 ppm). The contribution of main carbon forms to the total spectral inten-
sity was determined by integration of the corresponding chemical shift regions according
to [48–50]: 0 to 45 ppm (alkyl C), 45 to 110 ppm (O-alkyl C, subdivided in methoxyl/N-alkyl C,
45–60 ppm; O-alkyl C, 60–90 ppm; di-O-alkyl C, 90–110 ppm), 110 to 165 ppm (aryl C, subdi-
vided in aromatic C–H and C–C, 110–140 ppm; aromatic O-substituted C,
140–165 ppm), 165 to 185 ppm (carboxyl C); aldehydes or ketones, 185 to 220 ppm. The total
content of aryl C was calculated as the sum of the signals at 110–165 ppm ﬁelds. Signals
from alkyl C were recorded in the 0–110 ppm range. The degree of aromaticity (fa) was
determined as proportion of total content of aryl C components (110–145 and 145–165 ppm)
on total C (excluding the contribution in the range of 165–220 ppm).
2.2.5. Statistical Analyses
The effects of ﬁre on the forest litter were analyzed separately for each organic sub-
horizon. Statistical processing of the data was carried out using the Excel 2010 (Microsoft,
Redmond, WA, USA). Correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between
the temperature effect and the change in the organic horizon properties. Correlation coefﬁ-
cients (r-Pearson) were calculated using the STATISTICA 10.0 (Stat. Soft Inc., Tusla, OK,
USA); differences were considered signiﬁcant at the signiﬁcance level p< 0.05. Here weSustainability 2022 ,14, 16772 6 of 20
used testing correlation for the signiﬁcance of all analyses but13C NMR. All data presented
here are the mean values of three replications, except for13C NMR spectra (per sample)
because of its high cost and time needed to obtain the spectra.
3. Results
3.1. Fractional Composition
The experiment was conducted for all organic subhorizons (O i, Oe, Oa), but at the same
time samples with a different fraction content were used for O isubhorizon of forest litters
(Table 1). In pine forest we had studied two types of O isubhorizon samples. In the ﬁrst one,
the proportion of lichens was 22% (nature content), in the second, 51% (with the artiﬁcial
lichen addition). Two types of organic subhorizon Oi in the pine forest were highlighted
to distinguish an area where most lichens occur. The spruce forest sample with naturally
occurring moss content of 45% was studied. Pine forest litter samples are characterized by
a high proportion of lichens, while spruce forest litter samples are characterized by a high
proportion of moss remains.

3.2. General Properties and Speciﬁc Surface Area
One of the most substantial changes in the organic horizon samples during heating is
the loss of mass. In the lichen pine forest, the average weight loss was 10, 40 and 59% at
200, 300 and 500◦C, respectively (Figure 2). In the green moss spruce forest, the average
weight loss was 12, 34, and 52% at 200, 300, and 500◦C. Comparing the initial samples, the
most substantial decrease in mass was observed at 300◦C, and further heating up to 500◦C
led to a relatively smooth decrease in the amount of organic matter◦C. The loss of mass of
organic matter is obvious and signiﬁcant (r = 0.95, p< 0.05). It must be noted that the mass
loss is slightly different for the organic horizons of different forest types. The differences
are likely to be related to the chemical composition. A minor morphological change occurs
until 200◦C. The organic horizons are becoming semi-brown (color). At the temperatures
of 300 and 500◦C organic matter is becoming black.

3.3. Carbon and Nitrogen Content
The content of carbon and nitrogen in the sample remains increases with an increase
in the inﬂuence of temperatures. But the total content of carbon (C tot) and nitrogen (N tot)
decreases considering the initial mass of the sample and its loss during combustion. The
highest decrease of C totand C totwas revealed at a temperature of 500◦C (Figure 6). The
proportion of C totcontent in the lichen pine forest organic horizon samples decreased on
average by ~41%. The proportion of C totcontent in the green moss spruce forest organic
horizon samples decreased on average by ~32%. The proportion of N totcontent in the lichen
pine forest organic horizon samples decreased on average by ~0.76%. The proportion of
Ntotcontent in the green moss spruce forest organic horizon samples decreased on average
by ~1.1%. The temperature increase correlates strongly with the loss of C totand N totcontent
(r = 0.9, p< 0.05 and r = 0.89, p< 0.05, respectively).
The organic carbon content of the water-soluble fraction after pyrogenic exposure can
substantially increase and reach maximum values at 200◦C (up to 25 mg C/g), further
decreasing with increasing temperature. The content of N WSin the litter is characterized
by a maximum in the initial samples (Figure 7).
The water-soluble C and N content decreases by 10 to 34 times, depending on the type
of forest litter and burning time. It is shown that the concentration of nitrogen in the litter
of the pine forest at 200◦C is much lower than in the litter of the spruce forest. The upper
subhorizons (O i) of the pine forest litter have substantially lower levels of N WS, resulting in
an increased ratio of C WSto N WSat 200◦C. Here we revealed a strong negative correlation
between temperature increase and C wsand N wscontent (r =−0.67, p< 0.05 and r =−0.76,
r < 0.05, respectively).Sustainability 2022 ,14, 16772 9 of 20

3.3. Carbon and Nitrogen Content 
The content of carbon and nitrogen in the sample remains increases with an increase 
in the influence of temperatures. But the total content of carbon (C tot) and nitrogen (N tot) 
decreases considering the initial mass of the sample and its loss during combustion. The highest decrease of C
tot and C tot was revealed at a temperature of 500 °C (Figure 6). The 
proportion of C tot content in the lichen pine forest organic horizon samp les decreased on 
average by ~41%. The proportion of C tot content in the green moss spruce forest organic 
horizon samples decreased on average by ~32%. The proportion of N tot content in the li-
chen pine forest organic hori zon samples decreased on average by ~0.76%. The proportion 
of N tot content in the green moss spruce forest  organic horizon samples decreased on av-
erage by ~1.1%. The temperature increase correlates strongly with the loss of C tot and N tot 
content (r = 0.9, p < 0.05 and r = 0.89, p < 0.05, respectively).

Abbreviations: PF—pine forest litter, SF—spruce forest litter, O i, O e, O a—subhorizons of the studied

The organic carbon content of the water-so luble fraction after pyrogenic exposure 
can substantially increase and reach maximum values at 200 °C  (up to 25 mg C/g), further 
decreasing with increasing temperature. The content of N WS in the litter is characterized 
by a maximum in the initial samples (Figure 7). 
The water-soluble C and N content decreases by 10 to 34 times, depending on the 
type of forest litter and burning time. It is sh own that the concentration of nitrogen in the 
litter of the pine forest at 200 °C is much lowe r than in the litter of the spruce forest. The 
upper subhorizons (O i) of the pine forest litter have substantially lower levels of N WS, re-
sulting in an increased ratio of C WS to N WS at 200 °C. Here we revealed a strong negative 
correlation between temperature increase and C ws and N ws content (r = –0.67, p < 0.05 and 
r = –0.76, r < 0.05, respectively). 
The content of inorganic carbon in the form  of carbonates and bi carbonates, coal par-
ticles formed after fires increase s. The heating of the litter led to an increase in the concen-
tration of inorganic water-soluble carbon (IC), especially in the upper subhorizons. IC 
concentration increased 69 to 715 times. The lower subhorizons of the litters are charac-
terized by a lower content of IC. The test for significance revealed a strong positive corre-
lation between temperature increase and IC content change (r = 0.65, p < 0.05).

The content of inorganic carbon in the form of carbonates and bicarbonates, coal
particles formed after ﬁres increases. The heating of the litter led to an increase in the
concentration of inorganic water-soluble carbon (IC), especially in the upper subhorizons.
IC concentration increased 69 to 715 times. The lower subhorizons of the litters are char-
acterized by a lower content of IC. The test for signiﬁcance revealed a strong positive
correlation between temperature increase and IC content change (r = 0.65, p< 0.05).

300 degrees. Combustion of spruce forest organic horizons leads to ﬁre-induced changes
in the δ15N isotopic composition, namely, an increase in the content of δ15N in forest litter
samples at 500 degrees, but its decrease at 200 and 300. The content of δ15N in the pine
forest varies according to subhorizons. We identiﬁed that the increasing of temperature
lead to changed δ15N values: in O i–I and O i–II gradually increasing, but decreasing in O e+a.
The correlation between the increased temperature and changed δ13C values is negative
and quite moderate (r = −0.31, p< 0.05). The correlation between the increased temperature
and changed δ15N values is positive and weak (r = 0.09, r < 0.05).
3.4. CP/MAS13C NMR Data
The content of dominant molecular fragments in the organic matter of bedding differs
between initial and subsequent heating in all types of forest litters. These results are
provided in Table 2 and Figure A1.
As a result of13C NMR analysis, it was revealed that the initial soil organic horizons
samples are characterized by a high proportion of aliphatic compounds. As a result of
the experiment, it was revealed that the effect of temperature in the litter samples of the
lichen pine forest and green moss spruce forest led to the transformation of litter organic
matter (OM). Regardless of the fact that individual subhorizons have a different fractional
composition with different mass fractions of individual fractions, the results of changes in
OM are similar. A direct relationship between an increase in the combustion temperature
and an increase in the proportion of degree of aromaticity (fa) with signiﬁcant positive
correlation (r = 0.9, p< 0.05) was revealed. The maximum content of aromatic compounds
was found at a temperature of 500◦C.Sustainability 2022 ,14, 16772 11 of 20

The content of dominant molecular fragments in the organic matter differs between
initial and after-combustion in the litter samples from both types of forests. All initial
samples are characterized by three major peak values of13C NMR data in the ranges of
0–45, 60–95 and 95–110 ppm. Peak values in the range of 0–45 ppm are represented by a
high content of alkyl. High content of C related to aliphatic fragments double-replaced
by heteroatoms (including carbohydrate) and methylene carbon of ethers and esters was
demonstrated by 60–95 and 95–110 ppm ranges. A small pick of carboxyl groups, amides,
and their derivatives was demonstrated by 165–185 range. After-combustion samples in
turn demonstrated one wide peak in the 110–165 range characterized by aryl fragments. A
similar shift is reliably observed in all the samples studied.
4. Discussion
4.1. Direct Effects of Fire on General Properties
The weight loss at 200◦C is associated with dehydration, then a signiﬁcant weight loss
at 300 and 500◦C is explained by the destruction of organic matter [ 51]. It is known that a
large part of carbon can be lost at lower temperatures and organic matter can commonly
volatilize at temperatures between 200 and 315◦C [52]. It was revealed that the greater
weight loss is typical for the upper subhorizons of the litter. Organic carbon is known to
burn out most severely at a temperature of about 500◦C [53].
The experiment was conducted under certain conditions such as synchronous oc-
currence of ﬁre, identical temperature conditions (at room temperature, 200, 300 and
500◦C) and time duration (3 h) for all the studied organic horizons. This made it possible toSustainability 2022 ,14, 16772 12 of 20
correctly compare different analysis results. It is widely known that upon heating, physico-
chemical changes occur, the organic material is exposed to distillation, destruction, charring
(formation of “black carbon”), and complete oxidation up to CO 2and H 2O according to
the temperature and concentration of oxygen in the environment [ 54–56]. Organic matter
decomposes incompletely as a result of less severe ﬁres [ 57]. First months after the ﬁre, the
products of partial pyrogenic decomposition of organic horizons can be transferred into
mineral horizons [ 22,56]. Thus, it is essential to understand how changes in organic horizon
properties caused by combustion will affect the properties of the underlying mineral soils.
The main changes at lower temperatures (below 200◦C) affect mostly biological
properties [ 58], physical properties such as soil water repellency and aggregate stability
can also be altered [ 59]. Changes in organic horizons from low-intensity ﬁres are known to
stimulate further microbial growth [ 60]. At higher temperatures (above 200◦C), properties
are affected through combustion of SOM and production of pyrogenic organic compounds
and increases in soil pH. Already at 300◦C and even more so at 500◦C the samples
turn black, there is a strong transformation and destruction of the organic material of
forest litters.
With an increase of temperature, a transition of pH values to the alkaline region
is observed, which matches with Certini’s review [ 15]. Most likely, this is due to the
destruction of the organic material of the organic horizon and their ashing [ 61].As a
result of fires in forests an increase in pH values occurs due to an increase of carbonates
proportion [ 62] and it is likely because of volatilization of low-molecular organic compounds,
particularly acids. Probably, a strong transition to the alkaline direction in the temperature
range of 300–500◦Cis due to the denaturation of organic acids and the release of bases. The
results obtained are comparable with the results of a similar experiment [ 63]. If the burnt
matter of organic horizons will be transferred to the mineral horizons, it will probably
result in substantial changes, at least temporarily. Increase in alkalinity values is likely to
improve the quality of the studied soils [ 64], given that the underlying soils under study
are mostly acidic [2].
The correlation of the speciﬁc electrical conductivity (SEC) of soils and organic hori-
zons with their properties affecting the crop productivity is widely recognized [ 65,66]. The
measurement of SEC provides information about soil properties such as texture, drainage
conditions, cation exchange capacity and others [ 65,67]. The SEC of soils determine the
salinity of soils and thus their ability to transmit electricity in an aqueous solution. An
increase in SEC values, together with the rising of pH from acidic to alkaline as a result
of ﬁre, will lead to increased decomposition and a more saturated metabolism in soils in
the future [ 68]. The results of our experiment led to similar changes in organic horizons as
a result of ﬁres. These results are corresponding to literature data [ 51,63,69]. The results
obtained suggest an increase of the speciﬁc electrical conductivity role in the water-soluble
organic matter of the organic horizons when high temperatures occur. It is possible that
burnt material of organic horizons transferring down will change the properties of mineral
horizons. It is shown that in samples of spruce forest organic horizons, the SEC is higher
than in the pine forest organic horizon. The differences between SEC in the studied organic
horizons of forests are likely to be caused by the predominance of moss and foliage amount
in the fractional composition of the spruce forest organic horizons.
Speciﬁc surface area (SSA) plays an important role in processes of soil organic horizons,
including substances sorption, water-retention capacity and chemical reaction processes.
The soil sorption capacity can change depending on organic matter structure and content
in soils. It is likely this is due to SSA and general soil physical property relationships.
The total SSA is a factor that can relate a texture of medium with physical and chemical
properties. The result of our studies was a signiﬁcant increase in SSA values as a result
of ﬁre-induced transformation of organic horizon materials. The sorption and respiration
capacity of mineral horizons are likely to increase due to the mixing with SSA rich organic
horizons. During ﬁre events, organic matter undergoes a series of changes which include
free vaporization of moisture at 100◦C, degradation and decomposition of lignin andSustainability 2022 ,14, 16772 13 of 20
hemicellulose between 130◦C and 200◦C, chemical dehydration of cellulose at 280◦C,
burning at 500◦C [70,71]. Most likely, this is associated with the formation of nanosized
pores with a large surface area in the content of charred organic horizons.
It is shown that as a result of the inﬂuence of temperature, the changes in the stud-
ied parameters discussed above have similar regularities. Supposedly, all of the above
discussed changes in soil properties will lead to a partial increase of soil quality, which
may favorably affect the restoration of above-soil vegetation and the restoration of the
organic horizons.
4.2. The Impact of Fire on the Soil Organic Matter
The ﬁre to varying degrees affects all examined parameters of soil organic horizons
in lichen pine and green moss spruce boreal coniferous forests. Investigated parameters
were found to be substantially dependent on the temperature of heating of forest soil
organic horizons. It is widely known that the remains of burnt organic material transfer
down into the subsoil layers [ 14]. Thus, changes in organic horizon properties resulting
from combustion to a high probability will affect the properties of the underlying mineral
horizons of soils.
Organic content of C and N are often featured as one of the central focuses in the study
of soils because of the important role in SOM [ 13,15,63]. Organic horizon mineralization
determines the balance of carbon and nitrogen in soils [ 72,73]. The highest concentrations
of organic carbon and nitrogen involved in the cycle are concentrated precisely in the forest
soil organic horizons. Fires can greatly affect this balance [ 2,74]. It is evident that the carbon
proportion loss is one of the most considerable changes in the soil organic horizons upon
heating. Thus, the conducted studies have shown that, against the background of the
pyrogenic factor, there are changes in the properties of soil organic horizons, such as the
loss of the carbon content. The degree of transformation depends on the intensity of the ﬁre:
the greatest changes can be traced at 500◦C. It was found that the loss of nitrogen was less
intense than that of carbon during the combustion. Apparently, this is due to differences in
the destruction of organic substances at different temperatures. The C/N ratio practically
does not change with an increase in the inﬂuence of temperature, which indicates a uniform
destruction of the organic material of forest litters. The only signiﬁcant difference in the
C/N ratio was found between the organic horizons of soils of different forest types. The
C/N ratio in the lichen pine forest is on average twice as high as in the green moss spruce
forest. It is likely to be due to low nitrogen content in pine forest samples. It is known
that the pine forests of the study region grow on Podzol soils poor in ash elements and
nitrogen [75,76].
The content of C WSand N WSduring the heating experiment change. Following
combustion, the water-soluble forms of carbon and nitrogen content decreased. These
changes were caused by the fact that a substantial part of the organic matter was lost
during combustion. Similar results were obtained previously for soils of pine and spruce
forests of the Komi Republic [ 77] and larch forests of Central Siberia [ 63]. The decrease of
water-soluble element’s content is likely to be affected by the formation of charcoal that is
capable of absorbing a substantial part of organic compounds [14,78,79].
According to the data of C WS, the proportion of IC in the samples increases with
the inﬂuence of temperature. Ash produced at high temperatures is likely to increase the
soil’s inorganic compounds [ 80]. IC formed by after-ﬁres can increase in the solid phase to
carbonate forms [ 77] and carbonate and bicarbonate particles interacting with moisture [ 80].
IC is important for many properties and processes of the carbon component of the soil [ 81].
The increase of IC as a result of the organic horizons combustion can lead to a rise of IC
content in the mineral horizons.
Natural abundance of stable δ13C and δ15N isotopes is widely accepted as ﬁngerprints
to identify ecosystem processes [ 38,82,83]. Therefore, stable δ13C and δ15N isotope analysis
has been used to analyze after-combustion changes in organic horizons. Variation in
stable isotope values within organic horizons is associated with chemical and physicalSustainability 2022 ,14, 16772 14 of 20
environmental conditions and can change after wildﬁres [ 84]. As a result, the experiment
clearly indicates a decrease (facilitation) of the δ13C and an increase (weighting) of the
δ15N values. Previously, δ13C stable isotopes were found to have more weight after ﬁre
in soils [ 77,85], which is consistent with the logic of isotope behavior [ 86]. Cellulose is
enriched with δ13C relative to lignin and lipids in organic horizons [ 87,88]. It is probable
that the differential loss of compounds during heating could therefore explain the lower
δ13C value of thermally altered organic horizons. Similar results of δ13C facilitation and
δ15N weighting in organic horizons after ﬁre were received in the papers of Alexis et al. [ 89]
and Wang et al. [ 90]. Changes of the organic matter caused by ﬁres are likely not to lead
to major changes of the stable δ13C and δ15N isotope [ 23,91,92]. The differences between
types of forest soil organic horizons are visible. Organic horizons with partial content of
foliage seem to have δ15N depleted [ 93,94]. Further investigation is needed to determine
changes in δ13C and δ15N values which may occur at different temperatures and durations
that were not explored in this paper.
The relationship between thermal properties, elemental composition and chemical-
shift regions in the13C NMR is a useful tool for characterizing organic matter properties [ 29].
In similar papers, solid-state13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with cross
polarisation-magic angle spinning (CP/MAS13C NMR) was used to obtain changes of
ﬁre-induced C structures regions in organic matter [ 39,89,95]. The result of our research
was a substantial transformation of organic matter in organic horizons after ﬁre. The minor
differences of results in different type of forests are received. It is possible because of
the differences in the composition of the organic horizons of each type of forest and their
chemical degradation during burning.
A recent research suggests that low-intensity surface periodic wildﬁres decrease the
danger of catastrophic wildﬁres [96], and lead to create polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAH) largely resistant to decomposition [ 28,97]. Where burning occurs under aerobic
conditions, organic matter is completely oxidized to ash. A limited supply of oxygen in the
soil during the passage of ﬁre may be common, as indicated by the presence of pyrolysis
products of organic matter in soils following burning [ 98]. As the heat increases during a
wildﬁre, plant biomass is subject to chemical transformation involving the formation of
aromatic ring structures and the gradual condensation of smaller aromatic units [ 14,99].
According to Knicker et al. [ 100] as a result of combustion the solid-state13C NMR spectra
of the carbohydrate fraction is converted into condensed dehydrated material producing
intense signals in the aromatic region. This clearly happens due to the input of charred
material, whose signal is centered at ~130 ppm [101].
Fires with temperatures of between 250 and 460◦C could cause volatilization, charring
or complete oxidation of SOM. At these temperatures, Gonz ález-Pérez et al. [ 14] and Sant ín
and Doerr [ 58] indicated that aromatic compounds accumulate at the expense of aliphatic
ones. It may turn out to be the progressive transformation of the original biopolymers into
condensed macromolecular aromatic substances of disordered structure [ 100]. Aromatic
compounds are mainly formed of such compounds as lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose.
Condensation of complex aromatic compounds as a result of ﬁres can sequestrate the carbon
compounds from the carbon cycle for a long timescale. This occurs because these organic
compounds are difﬁcult to decompose. In turn with the formation of complex structures,
PAHs are formed. The toxicity of PAHs to biotic communities, including humans, is well
established [ 102–105]. PAHs are affected by the pore size distribution in soils and the
amount and nature of organic matter [ 106]. Hence the bioavailability and environmental
persistence of PAHs are closely related by organic matter [107–109].
Boreal forest ﬁres are known to be the main drivers of changes in soil organic com-
pounds [ 110,111]. The high severity and widespread ﬁres in the boreal region affect the
global scale through the release of char and its removal [ 112,113]. By contrast surface
and low-intensity ﬁres create conditions where coal particles are transported over short
distances and accumulate in soils [ 15,64,114]. Similar data on the increase in the propor-
tion of pyrogenic materials under the combustion of peat are described earlier [ 115]. ItSustainability 2022 ,14, 16772 15 of 20
is considered that biochar formed from combustion is a suitable material for carbon stor-
age in soils [ 116]. Formation of resistant organic materials is likely to be associated with
cyclization of biogenic organic-N such as peptides and amino sugars [117].
5. Conclusions
(1) The experiment was conducted to determine ﬁre effect on forest soil organic
horizons of lichen pine and green moss spruce forests properties. We clearly observe
ﬁre-induced changes in forest soil organic horizons. With an increase in temperature of ﬁre
(up to 500◦C), a strong transformation of organic substances was revealed. Remains of
burnt material cause concentration of charcoal particles. With an increase in the inﬂuence
of temperature, the pH, the speciﬁc surface area and the inorganic carbon content increase.
The aromaticity of organic matter in the organic horizons increases after the ﬁre as well.
(2) Post-pyrogenic soil organic horizons material will penetrate the underlying soil
mineral horizons. It is likely to improve soil quality. By improvement humiﬁcation
processes and, in addition, concentration of charcoal removed from carbon cycle are meant.
In turn, burnt organic horizons are likely to lead to negative changes in soils, namely to
an aromatic compound increase. The ﬁres strongly inﬂuence soil organic horizons and
therefore play an important role in soil processes. In view of the amount of carbon stored
in boreal region soils and the lack of knowledge on how ﬁre alters the soil organic horizon,
further research is required.
The study of the ﬁre inﬂuence on coniferous boreal forest soil organic horizons cur-
rently requires additional experimental and theoretical studies due to knowledge gaps. It
is necessary to develop an understanding of the ﬁre-induced processes in the organic hori-
zons, since organic horizons, reﬂect the existing trends in humus formation. Boreal forests
are the world’s largest forests; therefore, this paper could produce important information
that can be applied globally.

We aimed to determine if peatland fires have driven carbon accumulation 34 patterns during the Holocene. To cover spatial variability, six cores from three peatlands in the 35 Eastmain region of Quebec were analyzed for stratigraphic charcoal accumulation. Results show 36 that regional Holocene peatland fire frequency was ~2.4 fires 1000 yrs-1, showing a gradually 37 declining trend since 4000 cal yr BP, although inter- and intra-peatland variability was very high. 38 Charcoal peak magnitudes, however, were significantly higher between 1400 and 400 cal yr BP, 39 possibly reflecting higher charcoal production driven by differential climatic forcing aspects. 40 Carbon accumulation rates generally declined towards the late-Holocene with minimum values 41 of ~10 g m-2 yr-1 around 1500 cal yr BP. The absence of a clear correlation between peatland fire 42 regimes and carbon accumulation indicates that fire regimes have not been a driving factor on 43 carbon sequestration at the millennial timescale. 44  45 Keywords: peat, Quebec, charcoal analysis, Neoglacial, bog, accumulation, CharAnalysis, 46 threshold 47  48  3  49 Introduction 50  51 Ongoing climate changes affect the ecological dynamics of boreal ecosystems where wildfires 52 play a key role (Bergeron et al., 2010), including the carbon (C) balance of peatlands (Turetsky 53 et al., 2002). Peatlands are frequent in topographic depressions of the boreal and subarctic 54 regions, globally covering 3-4 million km2 (MacDonald et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2010). Due to 55 cool, humid, nutrient-poor and acidic conditions that restrict decomposition, ombrotrophic 56 peatlands sequester organic C and expanded vertically and laterally over millennia (Korhola, 57 1994; Korhola et al., 2010; Tolonen and Turunen, 1996). As a result, the global northern 58 peatland C stock, that started accumulating after the Last Glacial Maximum, presently contains 59 ~547 Pg (range: 473-621 Pg), constituting approximately a third of global soil C (Yu et al., 60 2010). Peatland fires influence local C dynamics by a release of C to the atmosphere through 61 combustion, estimated at 2.5-3.2 kg m-2 per fire (Pitkänen et al., 1999; Turetsky et al., 2002). In 62 addition, postfire C loss is generally important due to a delay in vegetation reestablishment 63 (Wieder et al., 2009). 64 In Canadian boreal zones, a potential increase of fire frequency and area burned during the next 65 decades (Bergeron et al., 2010; Flannigan et al., 2005) may force peatlands and upland areas to 66 switch from net C sinks to sources to the atmosphere. The negative effect of recurrent fires on 67 long-term peat and C accumulation has been established for different peatland types and regions 68 around the globe, yet research has been concentrated in boreal western and central Canada (e.g. 69 Camill et al., 2009; Kuhry, 1994; Robinson and Moore, 2000; Turetsky et al., 2002). In these 70 regions, climate-driven increases in fire frequency or severity may force peatlands to switch from 71 net sinks to sources in the course of the 21st century (Turetsky et al., 2002; Wieder et al., 2009). 72  4 Whereas in western Canada forested peatlands have developed under a dry continental climatic 73 regime, dominance of open bogs with relatively high water tables in the more humid climate of 74 eastern boreal Canada may inhibit differential fire and C accumulation dynamics (Payette et al., 75 1989; Payette and Rochefort, 2001). In the Eastmain region, peatlands have accumulated 76 considerable amounts of C during the last ~7000 years, regionally averaging 91 kg m-2 at a mean 77 rate of 16.2 g m-2 yr-1 (van Bellen et al., 2011a). C accumulation rates are given here as 78 “apparent” rates, representing the remaining accumulated C actually present in the peat 79 sequence, instead of “real-time” historical accumulation rates; the difference between these two 80 rates is due long-term decomposition of peat under anoxic conditions. 81 Peatland hydrology and vegetation strongly influence the potential for fire propagation, while the 82 amount of peat consumed varies with local and regional humidity conditions (Zoltai et al., 1998). 83 The highly variable spatial patterns of moisture conditions within and among peatlands are 84 closely linked to surface microtopography (i.e. hummocks and hollows) and vegetation 85 composition. Hence, interactions between vegetation and hydrology are important factors on 86 burning potential (Higuera et al., 2009). The presence of trees and shrubs in peatlands positively 87 influences fuel continuity and it is therefore associated with more frequent fires (Camill et al., 88 2009), and forested bogs may be more susceptible to burn as water tables are generally low. 89 Although burning in wet, open peatlands is evident under drought conditions (Fig. 1) open 90 peatlands often remain unaffected by fire, especially when local water tables are high and trees 91 are sparse (Hellberg et al., 2004). As a result, fire frequencies in open peatlands are generally 92 lower than those of adjacent forest stands (Camill et al., 2009; Kuhry, 1994; Zoltai et al., 1998). 93 Here, we present a study on the Holocene patterns of fire and C sequestration based on the 94 quantification of stratigraphic charcoal from three ombrotrophic peatlands in the Eastmain region 95 in boreal Quebec, northeastern Canada. Specifically, we aimed to estimate if peat fires have 96  5 driven long-term variations in C accumulation. Ombrotrophic peatland fire regimes, 97 ecohydrological change and C sequestration are directly or indirectly linked to climate 98 conditions, therefore we considered variations in climate regimes during the Holocene. Given the 99 evident negative influence of individual fires on peatland C sequestration (Wieder et al., 2009), 100 we hypothesized that if Holocene fire regimes had driven long-term C sequestration, this would 101 be manifested by a negative relationship between fire regimes and C accumulation rates (cf. 102 Kuhry, 1994). As the study by Kuhry (1994) in western boreal Canada, we verified correlations 103 between fire frequency and C accumulation rates, as well as between peatland fire-associated 104 cumulative charcoal and C accumulation rates. This study provides an understanding of 105 Holocene dynamics in peatland fire regimes in a relatively unexplored region. Besides, 106 additional knowledge on the influence of historical fire regimes on C sequestration may also 107 clarify the role of unforested boreal peatlands in future C cycling. 108  109  110 Study region 111  112 Three pristine peatlands were studied, Lac Le Caron (LLC), Mosaik (MOS) and Sterne (STE), 113 located in the Eastmain river watershed (51º50’-52º20’N/75º00’-76º00’W) (Fig. 2). Regional 114 mean annual temperature is -2.1 ± 0.2°C (January: -22.0 ± 0.5ºC; July: 14.6 ± 0.2ºC) and mean 115 precipitation is 735 ± 12 mm, of which about one third falls as snow (interpolated means and 116 standard errors of 1971-2003 NLWIS data; Hutchinson et al., 2009). Forest fire regimes are 117 among the most important in eastern Canada with actual fire cycles (i.e. the time required to burn 118 an area equivalent to the area studied) of 90-100 years (Mansuy et al., 2010; Payette et al., 1989). 119 Regionally, all large fires may be assumed wildfire as human activity is highly restricted. 120  6 Figure 1 shows an example of an Eastmain peatland burning pattern. A complete description of 121 peatland characteristics can be found in van Bellen et al. (2011a). 122  123  124 Methods 125  126 Fieldwork 127  128 From each of the three peatlands two coring sites were selected at opposing sections within each 129 peatland (Fig. 2). To obtain records with a sufficiently high temporal resolution, we aimed to 130 extract cores of at least 1.5 m in length, nearby the forest-peatland boundary, which was 131 identified by absence/presence of a surface Sphagnum cover and an organic horizon thickness of 132 >40 cm (Commission canadienne de pédologie, 1998). As the slope of the peatland basin was 133 highly variable between sites, the distance between coring location and peatland-forest limit 134 varied between 12 and 132 m. Coring was performed using a Box corer (10×10 cm width) to 135 sample the upper 1 m and Russian peat samplers (4.5- to 7.5-cm diameter) for deeper horizons. 136 Monoliths were wrapped in plastic, transferred to polyvinyl chloride tubes and stored at 4ºC until 137 analysis. 138  139  140 Charcoal fragment and peat C quantifications 141  142 Prior to specific treatment, cores were sliced into contiguous 1 cm subsamples in the laboratory. 143 From each slice, 2 cm3 was retained for macrocharcoal analysis, assumed large enough to 144  7 provide replicable data (Carcaillet et al., 2001). The subsample was soaked for at least 14 hours 145 in 5% KOH and carefully rinsed through a 355-µm sieve. Material larger than 355 µm was 146 transferred to a dish for dry analysis. Macrocharcoal fragments were counted using a binocular 147 microscope (×25). 148 Peat C contents were calculated from bulk density and loss-on-ignition (LOI) analyses. Bulk 149 density was determined from contiguous 1 cm3 subsamples after drying for 16 hours at 105ºC. 150 Subsequently, LOI analysis was performed at 550°C for 3.5 hours (Heiri et al., 2001). The 151 amount of organic matter (OM) was defined as the product of bulk density and LOI (Dean, 152 1974). The resulting OM was converted to organic C assuming a mean of 0.5 g C g-1 OM 153 (Turunen et al., 2002). 154  155  156 Dating and age-depth models 157  158 A total of 40 samples were submitted to Keck-CCAMS facility (Irvine, USA) for 14C accelerator 159 mass spectrometry (AMS) dating. Dated samples were selected either at levels of apparent 160 charcoal peaks or, when peaks were less conspicuous, at the boundaries of zones with abundant 161 fragments. Radiocarbon ages were calibrated using the IntCal04 calibration curve (Reimer et al., 162 2004) within the Bchron software package (Haslett and Parnell, 2008). Age-depth models were 163 constructed assuming vertical accumulation as a continuous monotonic process applying 164 piecewise linear interpolation. All ages were expressed as calendar years before present (BP = 165 before AD 1950). Age-depth models were based on these calibrated ages and the age of the 166 peatland surface when cores were extracted, established at -56 cal yr BP (i.e. AD 2006). C 167  8 accumulation rates were calculated for different sections of each core by dividing the C mass by 168 the period of accumulation and correcting for a uniform surface area (Clymo et al., 1998). 169  170  171 Origin of peat charcoal deposits 172  173 Long-term reconstructions of fire regimes from sediment records in lakes and peatlands are 174 generally inferred from macroscopic charcoal quantification from sediments, with peaks in the 175 number of charcoal fragments reflecting “local” fires, i.e. at a 500-1000 m distance (Ali et al., 176 2009b). Stratigraphic charcoal presence is generally quantified by charcoal accumulation rates 177 (CHAR; expressed as pieces cm-2 yr-1). Here, we assumed that fires originate from the upland 178 forest with some of these potentially spreading into peatlands, leaving patchy patterns in case 179 spatial variability in ecohydrology is important (e.g. Fig. 1). Depending on injection height, fire 180 intensity, forest type, wind speed, and local topography, charcoal fragments are dispersed over 181 large distances; therefore some of the charcoal fragments found in peatlands may be originating 182 from the upland forest. In general, small particles tend to travel farther than large ones (Clark, 183 1988; Lynch et al., 2004; Ohlson and Tryterud, 2000; Peters and Higuera, 2007). Thus, we 184 assumed that quantification of large charcoal fragments (>355 µm) could be a means of 185 establishing a peatland fire history. As taphonomic processes controlling the accumulation of 186 charcoal in peatland and lacustrine environments are different, we needed to adjust the 187 methodology to identify fires from charcoal records. 188  189  190 Peat fire identification 191  9  192 Prior to the analysis of charcoal records, all cores were rescaled to a constant sample age 193 resolution, defined by the median value, to reduce biases resulting from changes in sediment 194 accumulation rate. Data manipulation was performed using CharAnalysis (Higuera et al., 2009) 195 To identify peatland fire events, we hypothesized that the CHAR records were composed of a 196 slowly varying background value (Cback) and a peak component (Cpeak), comprising two 197 populations of CHAR values (Cnoise and Cfire). Variations in Cback are the result of long-term 198 variations in charcoal production, charcoal deposited after fire, occasional charcoal movement 199 through the acrotelm and possible slight contamination during sampling and preparations. We 200 applied a LOWESS smoothing (robust to outliers) to calculate Cback to detrend the CHAR 201 records. The Cpeak component was assumed to be composed of Gaussian distributions that were 202 modelled with a mixture model (Ali et al., 2009a; Gavin et al., 2006; Higuera et al., 2010), the 203 lower-mean population Cnoise reflecting long-distance charcoal input and random variability (cf. 204 Higuera et al., 2010), while the higher-mean population Cfire representing charcoal from local 205 peat vegetation. We used a local approach in determining the threshold separating Cfire and Cnoise, 206 i.e. the threshold was determined for sections of the Cpeak record rather than being uniform for 207 the entire sequence, as this approach takes account of changes in variability in the record 208 (Higuera et al., 2010). We consider the 99th percentile of each Cnoise distribution as a threshold, 209 and Cfire values exceeding this threshold are interpreted as peat fires. Finally, a minimum count 210 screening was applied to distinguish significant peaks (Gavin et al., 2006). To verify the 211 sensitivity of the reconstructions to different methods, results for different Cback smoothing 212 window widths and the local vs. global approach were compared. 213 Temporal variations in fire frequency were synthesized to obtain an image of historical 214 changes at the scale of the region. Secondly, the peak magnitude was defined as the number of 215  10 charcoal fragments associated with a single peak exceeding the final threshold. Previous studies 216 interpreted peak magnitude as a proxy for fire size, fuel consumption (Higuera et al., 2009), fire 217 proximity or intensity (Hély et al., 2010; Higuera et al., 2011; Whitlock et al., 2006). Regional 218 trends in peak magnitudes were reconstructed since 4500 cal yr BP, which was the maximum age 219 of core LLC_L4, to obtain an unbiased history (i.e. uniform sample size). To quantify the 220 relationship between fire frequency and C accumulation rates and between cumulative peak 221 magnitudes and C accumulation rates, regression analyses were performed on 1000-year mean 222 values for each record. Cumulative peak magnitudes are defined as the sum of the peak 223 magnitudes that lie within the same 1000-year interval. 224  225  226  227 Results 228  229 Chronologies 230  231 Radiocarbon dating showed ages of peat inception varying between 7321 cal yr BP (MOS_L1) 232 and 4586 cal yr BP (LLC_L4) (Table 1). Age-depth models show generally convex shapes, with 233 lowest rates of accumulation between 2000 and 1000 cal yr BP and apparent high rates towards 234 the surface (Fig. 3), an effect of the incomplete decomposition of recently deposited organic 235 matter. Median sample resolutions, which were used to rescale each record, varied between 22 236 and 48 yrs sample-1 (Table 2). 237  238  239  11 Peat fire histories 240  241 Following the recommendations of Higuera et al. (2010), window size for determination of Cback 242 was equivalent to >30*median sample resolution to obtain sufficient CHAR values for 243 calculation of local thresholds. Median Cback values for each core varied between 0.021 and 244 0.159 pieces cm-2 yr-1 and were consistently higher in cores from the western margin of each 245 peatland (LLC_L4, MOS_L4 and STE_L4) compared to those from the eastern margin 246 (Table 2). As fires are generally associated with western winds (Bergeron et al., 2004), variations 247 in Cback may thus be partly the result of variations in charcoal transport, and therefore the 248 location of the coring site relative to the adjacent forested upland may be a factor. The use of 249 locals thresholds resulted in a good separation of Cfire and Cnoise, as median SNI values were >4.5 250 (Table 2; Kelly et al., 2011). As the mean number of identified fires was not significantly 251 different for the various methods (varying smoothing windows and local vs. global thresholds), 252 we assumed our local threshold reconstructions to be suitable for the identification of fires. 253 The resulting total number of fires detected per core varied between 9 and 20 individual events 254 since local peat inception (Table 3; Fig. 4), representing a mean (±σ) Holocene frequency of 2.4 255 (±0.8) fires 1000 yrs-1. Regionally, fire frequency slightly diminished over the last 4000 years, 256 but temporal trends were highly variable as shown by the large whiskers (Fig. 5a). 257 Peak magnitude z-scores increased markedly after 1400 cal yr BP and remained high until 258 400 cal yr BP (Fig. 5b). Pooled peak magnitudes z-scores were significantly higher during the 259 1400-400 cal yr BP period compared to the previous and succeeding periods (t test; p = 0.0046; 260 Fig. 5b). 261  262  263  12 C sequestration and fire frequency patterns 264  265 Holocene apparent rates of C accumulation varied between 10.3 and 19.4 g m-2 yr-1 (Table 3). 266 Temporal variations in C accumulation rates were reconstructed within all cores, and showed a 267 minimum mean value of ~10 g m-2 yr-1 around 1500 cal yr BP (Fig. 5c). Regression analyses 268 show a significant but weak positive relationship between the mean fire frequency and C 269 accumulation rates (Fig. 6a), but no relationship between the cumulative peak magnitudes and C 270 accumulation rates (Fig. 6b). 271  272  273 Discussion 274  275 Peatland fire detection using stratigraphic charcoal 276  277 Reconstructing peatland fire regimes is a challenging issue because taphonomic processes 278 controlling charcoal sequestration are likely to be more variable in peatlands than in lacustrine 279 environments. Despite these complications, understanding the resilience of peatland C stocks to 280 variations in fire regimes is of major importance considering the feedback on climate change and 281 future greenhouse gas budgets. The SNI values of >4.5 for all cores show that charcoal peaks 282 were clearly separated from noise, even if the relative contribution of charcoal influx from 283 uplands remains unclear. Although charcoal peak identification could not be validated as no 284 independent regional fire records were available, the charcoal deposition pattern of a recent fire 285 aided interpretation. In 1995, the adjacent forest along the north-western section of MOS bog 286 burned, as indicated by fire maps (Ministère des Ressources naturelles et de la Faune, 2010), 287  13 although this fire did not affect the coring locations. Considering the apparent rapid 288 accumulation and some potential for small fragments to move vertically through unconsolidated 289 peat, this fire may have caused charcoal deposition in the upper 20 cm of the peat. Some 290 concentrated charcoal fragments were found in MOS_L1 and MOS_L4 around 18 and 14 cm, 291 respectively, yet these charcoal peaks were not significant. Thus, these fires were correctly 292 omitted in the reconstructed fire record. Another indication for the detection of strictly local fires 293 is the fact that both cores of each peatland did not register the same patterns in frequency, 294 showing that strictly local conditions, as peatland microtopography, may play an important role 295 in both fire potential and taphonomic processes. 296 In the Eastmain peatlands, charcoal horizons were visually indistinct throughout the sequences, 297 probably because of relatively low charcoal fragment quantities and poor peat preservation 298 resulting in a general dark appearance. The absence of charred Sphagnum in these horizons 299 implies that most burning was surficial, only charring the standing biomass, i.e. (small) trees and 300 shrubs. The apparent regional increase in peak magnitude during the late-Holocene could 301 theoretically be due to higher decomposition and thus loss of charcoal fragments towards older 302 deposits. Nevertheless, we have indications that differential decomposition was of minor 303 importance here as decomposed organic matter did not show a distinct trend downward in 304 detailed stratigraphic analyses (van Bellen et al., 2011a) and charcoal fragments were generally 305 large (>0.5 mm). 306 Considering the important intra-peatland variability and poor synchroneity in reconstructed fire 307 events, peatland fire frequency in the region appears to have been influenced principally by 308 strictly local factors, possibly dominated by local peatland hydrology and microtopography. 309 These results confirm that, in order to obtain complete understanding of the complexity of 310  14 peatland fire regimes, multiple records from multiple peatlands are essential to cover spatial 311 variability. 312 The reconstructed mean Holocene fire frequency of 2.4 fires 1000 yrs-1, comparable to a fire 313 interval of ~400 years, implies that mid- to late-Holocene peatland fires were less frequent than 314 the present-day upland fires as the actual mean regional forest fire cycle in the Eastmain region 315 was quantified at 90-100 years (Mansuy et al., 2010; Payette et al., 1989). This difference in fire 316 frequency is in accordance with the hypothesis that fires are ignited in the upland and only 317 occasionally proceed into peatlands, although forest fire intervals have been highly variable since 318 the mid-Holocene (Cyr et al., 2009), complicating comparisons between actual fire cycles and 319 Holocene averages. The Eastmain region peatland fire interval falls within estimates from other 320 boreal regions, even though spatial and temporal variability in fire activity is high. Zoltai et al. 321 (1998) estimated peat fire return intervals around 150 years in continental boreal bogs and 800 322 years in humid boreal bogs. In Manitoba, fire return intervals were quantified between 624 and 323 2930 years, depending on the criterion for local fire identification (Camill et al., 2009). In 324 western Canada, reconstructions in Sphagnum peatlands show temporally and spatially highly 325 varying frequencies, from mid-Holocene frequency of 5.3 fires 1000 yrs-1 to no recorded fires 326 over the entire accumulation in other sections (Kuhry, 1994). 327  328  329 Late-Holocene climate and fire frequency 330  331 We showed that mid- to late-Holocene peatland fire frequencies have been highly variable 332 spatially and temporally in the Eastmain region, while charcoal peaks were significantly higher 333 between 1400 and 400 cal yr BP. Previous research has indicated that boreal western Quebec 334  15 forest fire frequency was generally high during the warmer mid-Holocene before 3500 cal yr BP, 335 characterized by higher summer insolation and higher temperatures (Fig. 5d) whereas fire 336 frequencies were lower during the cooler Neoglacial (Ali et al., 2009a; Hély et al., 2010). 337 Comparisons between forest fire regime aspects and those of peatlands are complicated not only 338 by taphonomic differences between lake and peat records, but also by a possible differential 339 sensitivity of fire regime aspects to climate conditions. In forest stands, climate primarily 340 regulates large-scale fire activity by the occurrence of summer drought events with variations in 341 temperature, precipitation and wind speed (Bergeron and Archambault, 1993; Senici et al., 342 2010). However, in open peatlands, microtopography may be important, complicating the 343 potential for propagation of fire as microforms have differential sensitivity to drought conditions 344 (Benscoter and Wieder, 2003). Compared with forest stands, drainage and insolation dynamics, 345 and thus summer water table fluctuations, are linked to climate in a different manner. Summer 346 precipitation and to a lesser extent temperature are likely to influence summer water tables 347 (Booth, 2010; Charman et al., 2009). Furthermore, indirect climate effects and climate-348 vegetation interaction may exert an additional influence on peatland surface drought. Snow 349 cover, for instance, varies with vegetation type and microtopography (Camill and Clark, 2000), 350 and the combination of hummock Sphagnum and thin snow covers may allow permafrost 351 aggradation (Zoltai, 1993), which further complicates the climate-hydrology relationship. Thus, 352 even if regional climate has been a principal factor driving long-term variations in water tables 353 and moisture contents, upland forests and peatlands could potentially show differential trends as 354 they are driven by specific aspects of climate regimes, which in turn are mediated by specific 355 ecological feedbacks on climate conditions (van der Molen and Wijmstra, 1994; Wotton and 356 Beverly, 2007). 357  16 Corresponding to the trends obtained for uplands by Ali et al. (2009a) and Hély et al. (2010), 358 late-Holocene regional trends of decreasing fire frequency are, although subtle, observed in the 359 Eastmain peatlands. Nevertheless, we showed that intra-peatland variability is the dominant 360 characteristic of the Eastmain peatland fire regimes, emphasizing the importance of local 361 ecohydrology and microtopography on peatland fire regimes (see also Benscoter and Wieder, 362 2003). This importance may be reflected by the higher charcoal peak magnitudes between 1400-363 400 cal yr BP (Fig. 5b), corresponding to generally drier conditions in an independent record of 364 Eastmain region water table heights (Fig. 5d; details in van Bellen et al., 2011b). 365 Differing trends in fire frequency and peak magnitudes may be explained by differences in 366 controlling factors: peatlands may be more frequently affected by fire in absence of an important 367 microtopography, whereas peak magnitude, which may reflect charcoal production, may be 368 higher when dry microtopes are abundant or during periods of drought resulting in a low peat 369 humidity. 370  371 Fire frequency and C sequestration 372  373 We hypothesized that if fires were important millennial-scale drivers for C sequestration, the 374 studied fire regime aspects and C accumulation rates would show a strong negative correlation. 375 However, as regression showed only a very weak, positive relationship between fire frequency 376 and C accumulation rates (Fig. 6a), we conclude that Holocene C sequestration has not been 377 primarily driven by the studied aspects of the fire regime. As fires generally have a negative 378 effect on C sequestration through direct combustion and postfire net emissions (Turetsky et al., 379 2002; Wieder et al., 2009), short-term fire effects have apparently been masked by other, more 380 important autogenic or allogenic factors. Relatively low fire frequencies in the Eastmain region, 381  17 combined with a dominance of surface fires, may be the principal cause for the absence of a 382 significant influence of fire regimes on long-term C accumulation rates. 383 Long-term C accumulation patterns in peatlands are the result of combined effects of climate 384 variations (e.g. temperature, precipitation and moisture balance effects) and internal dynamics 385 (large-scale peatland surface topography, microtopography and basin morphology) (Belyea and 386 Clymo, 2001; van Bellen et al., 2011a; Yu et al., 2009). Eastmain peatland long-term C 387 accumulation has been affected by late-Holocene climate change (van Bellen et al., 2011b) that 388 was mediated by local geomorphology (basin morphology) and surface topography factors (van 389 Bellen et al., 2011a). Climatic cooling may have been the principal driving factor of C 390 sequestration, as limited rates have been identified between 2000 and 1000 cal yr BP in multiple 391 cores from the Eastmain region (van Bellen et al., 2011a; van Bellen et al., 2011b). As fires 392 generally originate from uplands, burning should be more frequent near the forest-peatland 393 boundary compared to the central parts (e.g. as visible in Fig. 1). Although lateral coring 394 positions may thus be advantageous for fire reconstructions, these sections are also more 395 sensitive to autogenic change because vegetation may be less resilient here than in central 396 sections of the peatland (Bauer et al., 2009; Bhatti et al., 2006). In addition, the forest-peatland 397 boundary, forming an ecotone of varying width, may be more frequently exposed to (episodic) 398 minerotrophic input, paludification and concomitant changes in vegetation. Thus, fire effects on 399 C accumulation may well have been minimized by a more important local effect of autogenic 400 factors. 401  402  403 Future perspectives on Eastmain peatland fire potential 404  405  18 Holocene peatland fire regimes have not been a determinant factor in long-term C sequestration 406 in the Eastmain region, and this may well be valid for most open peatlands in boreal eastern 407 Canada. Nevertheless, climate-fire-C cycling interactions may be variable in the light of present 408 and ongoing climate change (Bergeron et al., 2010). Peatland fire potential is linked to fire 409 occurrence in the adjacent uplands and therefore forest fire regime projections should be 410 considered for estimations of future fire regimes. Boreal Quebec climate projections, as modelled 411 by the Canadian Regional Climate Model (A2 scenario), show increases in summer temperature 412 of 2.0-2.5°C and ~10% increases in summer precipitation around 2050 relative to 1980 in boreal 413 Quebec (Plummer et al., 2006). As a result, fire regime scenarios for the Waswanipi region 414 (~200 km south of the Eastmain region) indicate an increase in annual area burned of 7% and an 415 increase in monthly fire risk of 30%, attaining 70% in July and 100% in August by 2100 (Le 416 Goff et al., 2009). These increases in upland fire activity suggest a higher potential for peatland 417 fire (Flannigan et al., 2009), yet climate may have a different influence on burning potential in 418 large, wet and open peatlands. A trend of higher water tables and reduced drought frequency 419 since the end of the last Little Ice Age episode (~AD 1850) in both peatlands and forest stands 420 has been observed in northern Quebec (Arlen-Pouliot and Bhiry, 2005; Bergeron and 421 Archambault, 1993; Lesieur et al., 2002; Loisel and Garneau, 2010; Payette and Delwaide, 2004; 422 Payette et al., 2004; van Bellen et al., 2011b). Following these results, climate projections for 423 peatland fire dynamics remain uncertain in northeastern Canada. This contrasts with scenarios 424 for western continental Canada, where peatlands presently persist at the dry climatic end of their 425 global distribution. A projected major increase in fire activity may cause western Canadian 426 peatlands to switch from net C sinks to sources (Wieder et al., 2009). 427  428  429  19 Conclusion 430  431 Holocene reconstructions show that the studied fire regime aspects probably have not been 432 important enough to have driven variations in long-term C sequestration in boreal peatlands of 433 the Eastmain region. The mid- and late-Holocene show important spatial and temporal variability 434 in fire frequency trends, implying a strong intra-peatland control on fire regimes, while rates of C 435 accumulation decreased to a minimum of ~10 g m-2 yr-1. Charcoal peak magnitudes increased 436 significantly after 1400 cal yr BP, possibly the result of the short-term occurrence of dry peatland 437 surface conditions. In order to cover the important variability in fire records, the use of multiple 438 records from multiple peatlands appears essential for a complete comprehension on driving 439 factors of long-term fire regimes. 440  441  442 Acknowledgements 443  444 We thank Hans Asnong, Géraldine St-Pierre and Benoît Talbot for field assistance and Maxime 445 Boivin, Anny Tadros and Antoine Thibault for assistance in the laboratory.

Abstract . Pyrogenic carbon (PyC), a major by-product of wildﬁres in boreal forests, plays
several critical roles in soil biogeochemical processes. However, PyC properties, including its
potential recalcitrance, may vary depending on its formation conditions. Our study aimed tocharacterize the chemical and physical properties of PyC formed under variable ﬁre severity inEastern Canada boreal forests; these latter represent an important fraction of ﬁre-affected
circumboreal ecosystems. A total of 267 PyC samples, produced by early-season wildﬁres in
2005–2007, were collected /C205 years after ﬁre from the forest ﬂoors of 14 black spruce sites
distributed across Quebec, to cover the range of ﬁre severity encountered in these forests.Early-season ﬁres occur frequently in Eastern Canada, and are predicted to increase in
regional and global scenarios of future ﬁre regimes associated with climate change. Selected
PyC samples were analyzed using elemental analysis, solid-state
13C nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and surface area analysis. The
NMR spectra of the PyC collected on low-ﬁre-severity sites were dominated by peaks
indicative of cellulose, while those for PyC from higher-severity sites were dominated by abroad peak assigned to aromatic carbons. Atomic H/C and O/C ratios decreased withincreasing ﬁre severity. By comparing ﬁeld samples to samples produced in the laboratory
under controlled formation conditions, we were able to infer that the temperature of
formation in the ﬁeld was low (75 8–2508C). In addition, for all PyC samples, the aromatic
carbon : total carbon ratio was small, suggesting that PyC produced by early-season ﬁres inthese boreal forests may be susceptible to relatively rapid degradation. Taken together, our
data suggest that boreal PyC may not be as recalcitrant as previously assumed, and that its
inﬂuence on soil biogeochemical processes may be short lived.

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide, boreal ecosystems cover 24 3107km2,
and the associated boreal forest soils, which store more
carbon per unit area than permafrost soils (Deluca and
Boisvenue 2012), represent an immense carbon pool
estimated at 227 31012kg (Kasischke 2000). The boreal
forest is characterized b y recurring wildﬁres that
produce signiﬁcant amounts of CO 2(Bond-Lamberty
et al. 2007, van Bellen et al. 2010). In black spruce boreal
forests of Eastern Canada, the combustion of the thick
forest ﬂoors is often incomplete and pyrogenic carbon
(PyC), also called black carbon, is a major by-product.
In addition to its potential importance as a global
carbon sink, there is evidence that PyC plays a central
role in soil fertility, in particular by stimulatingmicrobial activity and nutrient cycling after ﬁre (Wardle
et al. 1998, DeLuca et al. 2006).
Combustion-derived PyC consists of multiple possible
end-products, and it is difﬁcult to outline distinctive
classes with quantitative boundaries along the PyC
continuum (Masiello 2004, Lehmann and Joseph 2009).
While PyC is generally considered an important
component of the stable soil carbon pool (Kasischke2000, Preston and Schmidt 2006), some studies caution
against the assumption that all PyC is recalcitrant
(Hockaday et al. 2006, Czimczik and Masiello 2007,
Hammes et al. 2008, Preston 2009). As pointed out by
Preston et al. (2006), only part of the PyC continuumwith sufﬁciently low H/C and O/C ratios and highly
condensed aromatic structures, should be associated
with long-term stability. Similarly, PyC porosity and
surface area will directly affect the extent of its role in
retaining water, nutrients, and/or tannins, and itspotential to provide habitats for microorganisms (Zack-
risson et al. 1996, Hockaday et al. 2006). Thus, a
detailed knowledge of PyC chemical composition and
physical properties is a prerequisite to determine both itsManuscript received 20 June 2014; revised 3 November 2014;

1575fate and functions in terrestrial ecosystems (Keiluweit et
al. 2010).
Variation in formation conditions, such as fuel type,
maximum temperature reached during combustion,
abundance of oxygen, and duration of charring, canresult in major differences in PyC properties (Souce ´ma-
rianadin et al. 2013). In the ﬁeld, differences in
biophysical conditions, and associated fuel availability,
create spatial variation in wildﬁre intensity (Sousa
1984), and consequently severity (e.g., Turner andRomme 1994, van Wagtendock 2006). Fire thus results
in a mosaic of forest vegetation and soils burned to
varying degrees (Turner and Romme 1994), and in a
range of formation conditions for PyC. Spatial variabil-
ity in ﬁre severity and formation conditions occurs atscales ranging from thousands of square kilometers to
small patches of a few square decimeters. While that has
yet to be fully characterized, it is likely that PyC residues
have properties that vary within tree stands and across
the landscape.
This study provides a complete characterization of
wildﬁre-produced PyC, knowledge that is scarce in
boreal ecosystems. Further, it explores how formationconditions inﬂuence PyC properties and hence its
potential for recalcitrance and importance in regulating
post-ﬁre soil nutrient cycling. In 2005–2007, high ﬁre
activity, with an especially early onset, burned over 1.2
Mha in northern Quebec. This provided the opportunityto study the inﬂuence of early-season wildﬁres on PyC
properties. This is of particular signiﬁcance, as current
climate models predict an increase in ﬁre frequency for
this region, and a potential shift in ﬁre seasonality
toward the spring (Flannigan et al. 2005, Wotton et al.2010). We collected and analyzed PyC samples using aset of analytical methods to: (1) identify the range of
variation in their properties, and (2) determine how
these properties may be related to ﬁre severity. Wehypothesized that variations in ﬁre severity would
correspond to a continuum of PyC properties. We
further focused on PyC properties that directly affect itspotential for degradation, including its elemental and
macromolecular composition, as well as on several key
physical characteristics that control its biogeochemical
function in boreal black spruce ecosystems, including
porosity and surface area.

ATERIALS AND METHODS
Field sampling
A total of 14 ﬁres, ranging in size from 330 to
56 000 ha, were selected in 2010 from the black spruce–
feathermoss bioclimatic domain of Quebec (Appendix
A: Fig. A1). This domain covers a third of the provincial
territory, and is characterized by an average precipita-tion ranging from 850 mm/yr in the west to 1020 mm/yr
in the east (Bergeron et al. 2004, Cyr et al. 2007). Mean
annual temperature ranges from /C028C in the north to
just above 0 8C in the south (Carrier 1996). The majority
of soils are Humo-Ferric Podzols (Soil Classiﬁcation
Working Group 1998).
Within each ﬁre, 2–4 topographic gradients (topo-
sequences) were established inside an intact burnt stand,
i.e., burnt but not salvage-logged. Three 20 320 m
square plots were positioned on each topographic
gradient, and within each plot, nine round microplots
(1.5 m diameter) were sampled. We assessed both theaboveground (aerial severity) and belowground (soil
severity) impacts of ﬁre at the plot and microplot scale.TABLE 1. Characteristics of PyC samples produced by wildﬁres of the six severity classes observed in the ﬁeld, and of two

characteristics of the trees remaining on the plot: scorch
height, abundance of twigs, and presence of bark
splitting (Ryan 2002 and references therein). Preliminaryﬁeld observations indicated that aboveground ﬁreseverity was fairly homogeneous across and within sites,in that most trees were dead and burned over the fullbole height.
As opposed to aerial ﬁre severity, the amount and
visual appearance of organic matter left post-ﬁre at thesoil level varied greatly among both topographicgradients and microplots at each topographic position.Thus, we chose to further characterize soil ﬁre severityto capture the range of ﬁre severity at the sites. Toestimate soil ﬁre severity, we evaluated the impact of ﬁreon the consumption of the forest ﬂoor layers (i.e.,burning class), and we determined the main substratetype present within each microplot (Appendix B: TableB1). We used four burning classes: unburnt/scorched;
slightly, moderately, and severely burnt; and ﬁve
substrate classes: burnt forest ﬂoor; mineral soil; deadwood; rock; unburnt forest ﬂoor. Consequently, at thesoil level, six ﬁre severity classes (0–low to 5–high)combining the burning class 3substrate class options
were created, and attributed to each sample (Table 1).
All soils within the selected ﬁres presented a surface
layer containing PyC. This thin (average 2 cm) burntforest ﬂoor layer, which was produced during the lastﬁre event, overlaid parti ally decomposed ﬁbric and
unburnt humus (F or FH horizons; Soil ClassiﬁcationWorking Group 1998); the sampled material isreferred to as ﬁeld PyC hereafter. For each plot, wecollected three PyC samples ( ;20320 cm) represen-
tative of the overall plot soil ﬁre severity, close to thecenter of a microplot. Since the focus of our researchwas on forest ﬂoors, we sampled the following three
substrate classes: burnt forest ﬂoor, burnt forest ﬂoor,2 cm, and scorched forest ﬂoor (Table 1). A total of
267 PyC samples were collected in the ﬁeld, and asubset was chosen for analysis. We designed the
selection process to encompass the entire range of ﬁre
severity at the sampling loc ations. Triplicates (or
duplicates) of each soil ﬁre severity class, as previously
deﬁned, were randomly chosen among the collected
samples and further analyzed. This led to a total of 33ﬁeld PyC samples for detailed analysis (Appendix B:
Table B1).
PyC set produced under controlled laboratory conditions
We compared the ﬁeld PyC samples to a PyC
reference set, produced under controlled laboratory
conditions (Souce ´marianadin et al. 2013). To produce
the controlled PyC set, we selected biomass representing
the most common fuels available in Quebec black
spruce–feathermoss forests, including Sphagnum sp.
and Pleurozium schreberi , bark, branches, and needles
from black spruce, branches and needles from jack pine,
and twigs and leaves from Labrador tea ( Rhododendron
groenlandicum ). The charcoaliﬁcation experiments were
performed in a mufﬂe furnace under controlled maxi-
mum temperature (MT), which varied between 75 8C and
8008C for charring durations between 0.5 and 24 hours.
We adjusted the amount of oxygen present during PyC
formation by either placing the fuels in a moisture tin
with a cap pierced with tiny holes (tin ¼partial
pyrolysis), or by tightly wrapping them in tinfoil before
putting them in a sand bath (SB ¼full pyrolysis). We
submitted the samples from the PyC reference set to thesame analyses as the ﬁeld PyC.
Characterization of PyC chemical properties
Carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen concentrations were
determined by dry combustion on ﬁnely ground PyC
samples using a CE440 Elemental Analyzer (ExeterAnalytical, Chelmsford, Massachusetts, USA). The totalash and oxygen contents were estimated by difference
from the sample ash-free mass obtained after six hours
at 7508C, in accordance with ASTM Standard D1762-84
(ASTM 2007). Solid-state
13C NMR spectroscopy with
magic angle spinning (MAS) was used to characterize
PyC macromolecular structure.
We carried out the13C NMR experiments using a
Chemagnetics CMX Inﬁnity 200 Spectrometer (Varian,Palo Alto, California, USA), and a 7.5 mm Chemag-netics double resonance MAS probe to spin the samples
at 5 kHz. Experimental settings were the same as those
used for the PyC reference set (Souce ´marianadin et al.
2013), except that for the ﬁeld PyC samples we acquired
8580–8624 scans for the cross-polarization (CP) spectra,
and 888 scans for the direct polarization (DP) spectra.We divided the
13C NMR spectra into the following four
carbon regions: carbonyl (215–165 ppm); aromatic and
phenolic (165–110 ppm); O-alkyl and di- O-alkyl (110–
45 ppm); alkyl (45–0 ppm). We corrected for the
spinning side-bands using the regions with largeTABLE 1. Extended.

1.6 2.2 2.5June 2015 1577 SPRING FIRES PRODUCE LOW AROMATIC CHARSchemical shifts (290–215 ppm), following the same
methodology as Baldock and Smernik (2002).
Usually studies employ the CP technique, as it
generally allows for the acquisition of13C NMR spectra
in less time. However the CP efﬁciency for chars isreduced (Baldock and Smernik 2002) because of theabsence of particularly mobile
1H nuclei (Smernik et al.
2002). To verify that spectra acquired with CP wererepresentative, we used t he more quantitative DP
technique (Preston and Schmidt 2006) on a subset ofsamples. Applying Smernik and Oades ’(2000) method-
ology, we used spin counting to determine if the DPspectra were quantitative for the various carbons presentin the samples (Appendix C: Table C1). From theseresults, and by comparing CP and DP spectra, weconcluded that the CP spectra represented the distribu-tion of the total intensity quite accurately ( 67%),
further indicating that the CP efﬁciency for the
aromatic/quaternary carbons was about the same asfor the aliphatic carbons. Therefore, we used the resultsderived from the CP spectra for the remainder of thestudy.
Characterization of PyC physical properties
We characterized BET (Brunauer et al. 1938) speciﬁc
surface area (multipoint) and pore size distribution fromnitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms measuredat 77.3K on an Autosorb 1MP surface area analyzer(Quantachrome Ins truments Corporation, Boynton
Beach, Florida, USA). Prior to analysis, we outgassedsamples at room temperature or 105 8C for 19–26 hours.
We derived the BET surface areas (SA) from a multi-
point plot over a range of relative pressure, P/P
0¼0.05–
0.35 (7–8 data points). We performed the calculation ofthe different pore volumes using Autosorb 1 for
Windows 1.52.
We assessed PyC heterogeneity, notably the size and
shape of pores, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
High-resolution digital images of the surfaces of
different PyC samples were obtained using a ﬁeldemission SEM (JEOL 6301F; JEOL Limited, Akashima,Tokyo, Japan) with magniﬁcations ranging from 25 3to
50 0003. Before imaging them through the SEM, we
coated the samples with gold (Nanotech SEMPrep 2
sputter coater; Nanotech, Utica, New York, USA) toincrease their conductivity.
Statistical analyses
We used a one-way ANOVA to investigate changes in
PyC chemical characteristics using the
13C NMR and
elemental results of the 33 ﬁeld PyC samples in relationto ﬁre severity classes. The experimental units were themicroplots and their associated ﬁre severity classes.When data did not follow the ANOVA assumptions, we
used a Mood’s median test and a Kruskall-Wallis non-
parametric test. All comparisons were consideredsigniﬁcant at aof 0.05. We performed all statistical
analyses with SAS 9.2 (SAS 2010).

ESULTS
PyC physical and elemental properties
As can be seen on the SEM micrographs (Fig. 1), the
bulk of the cell structures of the original plant materials
remained unaltered. Microorganisms were visible onmost samples. In particular, we were able to observebacteria as well as various fungal structures, such ashyphae and hyphal tubes. The PyC samples correspond-

unless indicated otherwise.LAURE N. SOUCE ´MARIANADIN ET AL. 1578 Ecology, Vol. 96, No. 6ing to a class 0 ﬁre severity had a slightly higher surface
area (2.3 m2/g) than those associated with a high ﬁre
severity (SA ¼1.1 m2/g and 1.6 m2/g for class 2 and class
5, respectively). Overall, all analyzed samples exhibited
very low speciﬁc surface area (i.e.; ,3m2/g), and
porosity was dominated by macropores (Table 1).
Moreover, these values were similar to results obtained
for unburnt fuels.
The carbon content of the samples increased from
47%to 60%with increasing ﬁre severity (Table 1;
Appendix B: Table B1). The PyC collected on the low
ﬁre severity sites (classes 0 and 1) showed a signiﬁcantly
lower carbon content than PyC from the high ﬁreseverity sites (classes 4 and 5). The oxygen content
steadily decreased with increasing ﬁre severity (46 %to
36%), while the hydrogen content remained constant
(5%) from class 0 to 2, before decreasing to 4 %for class
5. The nitrogen content was only weakly related to ﬁre
severity; it increased slightly up to class 3 (1.1 %to 1.8%)
and then appeared to reach a plateau (Table 1). The ashcontent ranged from 4 %to 34%; it increased slightly
from class 0 to 3, then more importantly from class 4 to
class 5 (Table 1). The atomic H/C and O/C ratios bothdecreased with increasing ﬁre severity (Fig. 2). PyC from
classes 0 and 1 had signiﬁcantly higher atomic ratios
than PyC from classes 4 and 5 (H/C ratio) and classes 2,4, and 5 (O/C ratio).
PyC molecular composition
The cross-polarization
13C NMR spectra acquired for
the ﬁeld PyC associated with low ﬁre severity showed a
distribution of carbon groups very similar to that inunburnt fuels (Fig. 3a; Appendix C: Table C2). Spectra
were dominated by carbohydrates, as conﬁrmed by the
presence of peaks represe ntative of cellulose and
hemicelluloses; i.e., at 62, 72–75, and 105 ppm (Wikbergand Maunu 2004, Melkior et al. 2012), and showed
limited presence of lignin. Lignin was identiﬁed by peaks
between 110 and 165 ppm, the aromatic carbonsappearing in several (mostly) broad peaks of weak
intensity (Fig. 3a; Appendix C: Table C2).
Spectra from PyC collected on sites associated with
ﬁre severity classes 2 and 3 were very similar (Fig. 3b).
They differed from the PyC spectra associated with ﬁreseverity classes 0 and 1 by an increase in the contribution
of the alkyl carbons (peaks at ’30 ppm) and the
emergence of two peaks characteristic of aromaticcarbons: one at 130 ppm assigned to polyaromatic
hydrocarbons (Baldock and Smernik 2002), and one at
150 ppm ascribable to O-substituted aromatic carbons
(furans). In the spectra of PyC associated with class 4-
ﬁre severity, the relative contribution of the two peaks in
the aromatic region, as well as the peak in the alkylregion, continued to increase (Fig. 3b). Conversely, thecontribution of signals relative to cellulose (72 and
105 ppm) decreased. The broad peak centered at 30 ppm
also became slightly narrower, suggesting that thevariability in the composition of the alkyl groups wasdecreasing. In contrast, the
13C NMR spectra obtained
for the PyC associated with high ﬁre severity (class 5)
was dominated by broad peaks related to aromatic andphenolic carbons. They were similar to spectra of fuels
thermally treated at 250 8C under pyrolytic conditions
(Fig. 3c). These spectra were dominated by two broadpeaks: one in the aromatic and phenolic regions, and the
other one in the alkyl region. Peaks associated with
cellulose (centered at 84 ppm and 89 ppm but also at74 ppm and 65 ppm) were almost absent for the PyCproduced from Rhododendron andSphagnum at 2508C,
and were entirely absent for the PyC produced under
oxic conditions. On the other hand, hemicelluloses(173 ppm) and lignin (56 ppm) structures were still
clearly visible. Finally, for the class 5 PyC, carbohy-
drates and lignin biomolecules were still present, eventhough their relative contribution substantially de-
creased (Fig. 3b).
With increasing ﬁre severity, we observed a statisti-
cally signiﬁcant increase in the aromatic and phenolic
carbon contributions (Table 1). There was also a small(nonsigniﬁcant) increase in the contribution of the
carbonyl carbons. Furthermore, PyC exhibited a higher
proportion of alkyl carbons, corresponding with theemergence of the broad peak centered at 30 ppm (Fig.
3a). Overall, from low to high ﬁre severity, the
13C
NMR spectra shifted from intensity dominated by O-
alkyl and di- O-alkyl signals (cellulose and hemicellulos-
es) to intensity dominated by peaks associated with aryl

alkyl and di- O-alkyl carbon was signiﬁcantly different
between ﬁre severity classes 0–1, and class 5. Theseobservations are consistent with those from the calcu-lated atomic ratios, that is, an increase in aromaticcontent (Fig. 2).Properties of the PyC reference set
We incorporated the results of the PyC produced
under controlled conditions on the PyC continuum (Fig.
4) to follow how chemical and physical propertieschange with an increasing maximum temperature offormation. Values and observations summarized in Fig.
FIG.3 .13C NMR CP spectra of (a) low ﬁre severity PyC (class 0) compared to unburnt Sphagnum and a ﬁbric layer; (b) PyC
samples produced by wildﬁres of the six ﬁre severity classes observed in the ﬁeld (class 0–5); and (c) high ﬁre severity PyC (class 5)
compared to Sphagnum andRhododendron thermally treated at 250 8C. Main peaks include: cellulose, 74, 105 ppm; hemicelluloses,
21, 173 ppm; char, 25, 130, 150 ppm; lignin, 56, 110–165 ppm.LAURE N. SOUCE ´MARIANADIN ET AL. 1580 Ecology, Vol. 96, No. 64 are derived entirely from results of PyC produced in
the laboratory under full pyrolysis (Souce ´marianadin et
al. 2013). With increasing maximum temperature, we
observed a degradation of the fuel macromolecules(cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin) and formation of
aromatic structures, with a concomitant increase in PyC
carbon content and a decrease in H/C and O/C ratios,
consistent with the NMR results, i.e., an increase in
carbon condensation. As for PyC physical properties, an
increase in the maximum temperature induced an
increase in PyC speciﬁc surface area, with a shift froma porosity dominated by macropores to a porosity
dominated by micropores. This was accompanied by a
progressive destruction of the cell structures of the fuel.
Overall, the physical and chemical properties of the ﬁeld
PyC matched the properties of the laboratory PyC
produced at low temperatures ranging between 75 8C and
2508C (Figs. 2 and 4).
D
ISCUSSION
Formation conditions for the ﬁeld PyC
Hammes et al. (2006) reported that an atomic H/C
ratio.0.5 characterizes chars formed at temperatures
,5008C. By comparing results from the ﬁeld samples
(Table 1) and the PyC produced under controlled
laboratory conditions (Fig. 2), we can conclude that
the high atomic ratio values obtained for the ﬁeld PyC
samples were characteristic of a low temperature of
formation. Both elemental analysis and13CN M R
spectroscopy conﬁrmed that all ﬁeld PyC samples were
the products of forest ﬂoor exposed to temperatures
ranging from 75 8C to 250 8C. Results also suggested thatpyrolysis conditions prevailed during the production of
this PyC, indicating formation by smoldering ﬁre.
Wildﬁres progress through different phases (DeBano et
al. 1998); a crown ﬁre associated with ﬂaming combus-
tion generally transitions to a smoldering ﬁre, affecting
the forest ﬂoor through glowing combustion. If the
forest ﬂoor is dry, the combustion is more complete and
the organic layer is almost entirely consumed; this was
not the case in the present study. The absence of a
relationship between aerial ﬁre severity and soil ﬁre
severity further suggests that the ﬁre behavior in the
canopy and at soil level was disconnected. Under these
conditions, ﬁre severity at the soil level is driven bymicroscale patterns, such as differences in microtopog-
raphy, rather than ﬂammability of the canopy. The C
content of the PyC produced by wildﬁre (Table 1;
Appendix B: Table B1) was slightly lower ( ,60%) than
the values obtained for the PyC produced under
controlled conditions at similar temperatures (Fig. 4),
suggesting a more complete combustion in the former
context (Krull et al. 2009).
Under observed ﬁeld conditions of the highest ﬁre
severity (class 5), the
13C NMR spectra indicate that the
forest ﬂoor underwent thermal alterations. Speciﬁcally,
there was a visible decrease in peaks associated with
cellulose and hemicellulose, accompanied by a relative
increase in the contribution of peaks associated with
lignin. A potential explanation is that while cellulose andhemicellulose were subject to (thermal) degradation, the
temperature remained below the pyrolysis temperature
of lignin (280 8–5008C [Miyanishi 2001]), consequently
increasing its relative contribution to the total signal
intensity. For the highest ﬁre severity class, aromatic

controlled laboratory conditions. Samples produced by wildﬁres (ﬁeld PyC) are contained within the gray rectangle. PyC that isformed at the threshold temperatures (350 8C, 425 8C, and 800 8C, printed in gray type) show chemical and physical differences
compared to PyC formed at lower temperatures.June 2015 1581 SPRING FIRES PRODUCE LOW AROMATIC CHARSnon-oxygenated carbons (signal at 130 ppm) dominated
the13C NMR spectra, suggesting that at this stage,
condensation of the origin al macromolecules into
aromatic polymers had begun. This suggests an increase
in condensation with severity, which agrees with theobserved decrease in atomic H/C and O/C ratios along
the same severity gradient. To further illustrate this
phenomenon, we calculated the degree of aromatization,which corresponds to the ratio (aromatic and phenolic C
[165–110 ppm]) to ( O-alkyl and di- O-alkyl C þalkyl C
[110–0 ppm]), and is an indicator of the increasinglycondensed nature of chars (Keiluweit et al. 2010). As
expected, there was an increase in the degree of
aromatization with increasing ﬁre severity (Table 1).
Surface area and pore volume have been shown to be
principally controlled by maximum temperature (Brownet al. 2006) and duration of charring (Rutherford et al.2005). Both are expected to increase with harsher
formation conditions, including higher maximum tem-
perature and/or longer charring duration. Hammes et al.(2006) reported PyC surface areas ,25 m
2/g for low
temperatures of formation ( ,5008C), while high tem-
peratures (500 8–10008C) led to surface areas of 214–
336 m2/g. Rutherford et al. (2005) also reported a very
small micropore volume ( /C200.001 cm3/g) for pine wood
and pine bark treated at 250 8C. The low values we
measured on our samples conﬁrm the low temperatures
of formation, corroborati ng the chemical analysis
results. The absence of major destruction of the fuelcell structures, as observed on the SEM micrographs
(Fig. 1), conﬁrms an average low formation temperature
across the severity gradient. The relative contribution ofmicroporosity remained constant with increasing ﬁre
severity, suggesting that the temperature of PyC
formation was too low to create new microporosity.These results match changes in chemical structuresuggested by the
13C NMR spectra (Fig. 3b), where it
is evident that the conversion of alkyl to aromatic
carbon remained incomplete. The rigid structure thatfused-ring aromatic carbons provide and in which
micropores develop was not yet fully established
(Rutherford et al. 2005). In addition, at low tempera-tures, a certain proportion of the porosity, especially the
microporosity, could have been occluded by tars and
other condensed volatiles (Downie et al. 2009). Thisprocess can also disrupt pore continuity, leading to small
speciﬁc surface areas and pore volumes. Finally, a low
surface area could also be associated with low thermalramping (Brown et al. 2006). Wildﬁre thermal rates are
typically low, characterized by values between 2 8C and
178C/min for natural smoldering combustion (Miyanishi
2001), and a slow thermal ramping rate (0.5 8–3.38C/min)
tends to produce chars with low surface area ( ,0.5 m
2/
g).
The chemical characteristics of PyC produced in
Quebec boreal black spruce forests are quite different
from the characteristics of PyC produced by wildﬁres inother ecosystems. For example, a moderate intensityMediterranean wildﬁre that affected a stone pine ( Pinus
pinea L.) forest produced PyC that was much more
condensed and contained more aromatic C (Nocentini et
al. 2010) than even the PyC from our highest ﬁre severity
class. In a more comparable boreal ecosystem; i.e., aSiberian Scots pine forest ( Pinus sylvestris ssp.sibirica
Lebed) affected by a surface ﬁre (Czimczik et al. 2003),
the
13C NMR spectra obtained were more similar to the
spectra of class 5 ﬁre severity from the present study.
PyC properties and implications for their function in black
spruce forests
NMR spectroscopy and elemental analyses indicate
that PyC produced in the Quebec black spruce forests by
2005–2007 wildﬁres was not composed of carbonmoieties with intrinsic chemical properties (molecular
structures) known to resist microbial degradation.
Indeed, the PyC produced by these wildﬁres appearedto be composed of transition and amorphous chars; i.e.,
low in aromatic structures. One important consideration
is that all ﬁres in our study occurred early in the ﬁreseason; relatively low ﬁre severity was observed at the
soil level, validated by low organic matter consumption
(Boifﬁn and Munson 2013). Nonetheless, PyC proper-ties varied predictably according to changes in ﬁreseverity observed at the microplot level.
Pyrogenic carbon porosity may play an important
role in ecosystem successional processes through ad-
sorption of phenolic compounds that otherwise may
inhibit natural regeneration of black spruce trees.Zackrisson et al. (1996) showed that young ( ,100 yr)
charcoals were able to adsorb phenolic compounds
produced by ericaceous shrubs in boreal forests ofnorthern Sweden. They linked the presence of theseactive charcoals to enhanced microbial biomass in the
litter and higher stand productivity. As shown by
Joanisse et al. (2007), condensed tannins typically foundin high concentrations in Kalmia litter inhibit microbial
enzyme activity and decrease nitrogen mineralization.
As nitrogen is a main limiting nutrient in boreal forests,PyC porosity could thus play a critical part in post-ﬁre
tree reestablishment. Addition of PyC to forest ﬂoors
resulted in the reduction of free polyphenols content(DeLuca et al. 2002), an increase in nitrogen availability
(DeLuca et al. 2006, MacKenzie and DeLuca 2006), and
a stimulation of boreal tree seedlings growth in agreenhouse experiment (Pluchon et al. 2014). Similarly,Keech et al. (2005) showed that PyC physical properties
played a major role in determining its sorptive capacity.
As shown for the reference set, the increase in PyCporosity is related to the temperature of formation (Fig.
4), although thermal ramping rate and charring
duration are important factors (e.g., Brown et al.2006). Unlike the laboratory-produced PyC or natural
PyC formed at high temperatures used in the above
studies, the potential for tannin adsorption (i.e., averagemeasured speciﬁc surface area) was relatively low for
our ﬁeld PyC. This suggests that the adsorptive capacityLAURE N. SOUCE ´MARIANADIN ET AL. 1582 Ecology, Vol. 96, No. 6of wildﬁre-produced PyC cannot be taken for granted.
However, these PyC samples were collected 4–5 yearsafter wildﬁre; hence it is possible that the original
porosity was higher but decreased over time. Indeed,
phenols interacting with activated carbon may undergoan irreversible adsorption (Grant and King 1990). While
the importance of PyC in ecosystem functioning, e.g., as
a habitat for microorganisms involved in nutrientcycling (e.g., Saito 1990, Pietika ¨inen et al. 2000), should
not be dismissed, our results indicate that its adsorptive
role is either limited or at best short-lived in these borealblack spruce forests. Although a deﬁnitive causal
relationship is difﬁcult to establish, the presence at our
study sites of a partially burnt forest ﬂoor covered by aslightly charred layer was linked to critically low black
spruce regeneration (black spruce to jack pine [Boifﬁn
and Munson 2013]).
The production of PyC during forest ﬁres, and its
successive accumulation as a recalcitrant carbon pool
over several ﬁre cycles, could partially offset the huge Closses taking place during the combustion events. In
boreal forest soils, PyC comprises 1–50 %of the total
carbon present in surface mineral horizons (Deluca andBoisvenue 2012). Similarly, we previously showed that
many Quebec boreal forest ﬂoors include a PyC-rich
layer close to their interface with the underlying mineralsoils, and that PyC represents, on average, 7–8 %of the
total carbon present in the mineral soils (Souce ´maria-
nadin et al. 2014). PyC produced by wildﬁre is generallyconsidered to have very slow turnover, and as such, to
be an important sink in the global carbon cycle (e.g.,
Forbes et al. 2006, Lehmann et al. 2008). However, thesurﬁcial PyC layers we studied contained little aromatic
carbon, and are unlikely to persist in these boreal forest
ecosystems for very long. Consequently, we would liketo warn against hasty generalizations, and furtheremphasize that it is crucial to consider both the PyC
properties (low vs. high aromatic content) and the
environment within which it will interact (e.g., thickforest ﬂoor vs. mineral soil) before inferring that the
PyC will contribute substantially to the inert carbon
pool.
The 3–5 8C mean annual increase in temperature
projected for the end of the century (Lemprie `re et al.
2008) is predicted to result in an increase in ﬁre
frequency throughout the boreal forest zone, although
with regional differences. By 2090, the black spruce–feathermoss domain is expected to experience a 4–5 8C
increase in summer temperature, and an increase in
summer precipitation, although in the southern sectorthe precipitation increase (0–10 %) should be less than in
the northern sector (25–50 %). Overall, ﬁre seasons are
expected to be longer (averaging þ30 days), ﬁres to be
more severe (Wotton et al. 2010), and the southernsectors to be more prone to an increase in ﬁre frequency
and severity. On the other hand, ﬁre seasonality is
expected to shift toward an earlier ﬁre season, whichwould favor lower ﬁre severity at the soil level,producing the same low condensed PyC as reported
here for the 2005–2007 ﬁres. Under these conditions,PyC should not be expected to be much morerecalcitrant than unburnt forest ﬂoor. Hence, our studyreveals how a change in ﬁre regime toward lowerseverity could potentially reduce the relative stability ofPyC produced and its contribution to longer-term stablecarbon pools in boreal forest soils. Tannin adsorptionby PyC and its positive effects on ecosystem functionand tree growth could also be hampered by this shift in
ﬁre regime.
C
ONCLUSION
In Quebec black spruce forests, 2005–2007 early-
season wildﬁres produced forest ﬂoor PyC that dis-played a relatively low degree of aromatization andcondensation. The PyC chemical properties were relatedto ﬁre severity, with an increase in ﬁre severity inducingan increase in aromatization. However, the aromaticcontent of all ﬁeld PyC samples was low when comparedto the range of known values along the PyC continuum,which suggests a low intrinsic potential for recalcitrance.The porosity of the analyzed samples, hence theiradsorptive capacity for tannins, was also low, suggesting
that PyC was unlikely to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence nitrogen
mineralization in these boreal forests. Overall, theseresults are representative of PyC produced during early-season wildﬁres, and they provide insight into the mostcommon type of PyC that would be produced in thescenario where early-season ﬁres increase in frequency.Finally, these results can inform modeling of carboncycles in boreal forests, by providing key information onthe potential longevity of PyC pools.
